On top of that, Romney seems made for TV, with his good looks and nuclear family. What's not to like?</p><p>All of that is true- and that's exactly the problem. For most of his career, Romney was distinguished by his pragmatic, socially liberal brand of politics, being moderately pro-choice and gay rights. But ever since he started running for president, eager to ingratiate himself with the right, he's chucked these stances in the trash, opening him to charges of flip-flopping. Not to mention, his Mormon religion means evangelicals distrust him from the jump.</p>",

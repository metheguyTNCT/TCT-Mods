You feel exhausted, after the long weeks of campaigning, but you can take comfort from the fact that you’ve now confounded the expectations of the pollsters twice over; first in 2000, and then again tonight. The pundits said you were on the ropes, a one-term calamity, but I guess they were wrong about that. As you watch the last few states being called in your favour on TV, you reflect on another surprise triumph at the ballot box. The House and Senate are still red, so you’ll have no trouble passing legislation, at least for the next couple of years. Strengthening campaign finance reform, and working out a long-term solution to Iraq’s difficulties, should be priorities for you to tackle.

While the polls tightened a little heading into election day, you somehow knew in your heart that with a controversial war under your belt, and Clark’s charismatic debate performances, it would take nothing short of a miracle for you to emerge as the victor. It’s difficult to tell how history will judge your presidency; you reacted to the initial aftermath of 9/11 with grace and dignity, but your intensely controversial foreign policy choices over the past year likely tarnished your image among voters.

It seems that the electoral college has deadlocked, and the election will now go to the House. Since Republicans control a majority of state delegations, that means that you will probably be able to serve a second term as President- but under bizarre circumstances, and with a miniscule amount of political capital to fall back on.  Mark Salter tells you to cheer up; after all, you’re still the President, and both Reagan and Clinton managed to cope just fine with being lame-duck incumbents during their respective second terms.

But none of that matters, she was the only candidate besides you and Biden to get any media time during this campaign, though none of it was necessarily positive. Considered by many to be the \"Orb Lady\" who went on the debate stage and spouted spiritual nonsense, it could be said she'll sink your already-thin chances at winning the election.</p><p>She was helpful in the primary fight, managing to get a good placement in Iowa and New Hampshire due to protest voting in the aftermath of the primary schedule change. Naturally, none of the other Vice Presidential candidates will take her very seriously, but with her mystical powers, I'm sure Marianne will show them not to mess with the magic.</p>",

An election in which two presidents are not running on their party's ticket is unprecedented, let alone an election in which an incumbent President was essentially couped from the ticket.</p><p>President Joe Biden, now at the head of the \"Liberal Party\" ticket, facs the challenge of maintaining his large polling lead, and avoiding bleeding progressive support to RFK Jr. Meanwhile, RFK Jr. needs to do the inverse, appealing to progressives while downplaying his anti-vaccine activism. DeSantis struggles to maintain his direction of \"Trumpism without Trump\", while Trump seeks to keep the Trump name on the ballot for yet another cycle.</p><p>The Silicon Valley Bank Collapse was a deeply destabilizing influence upon the American markets. Following the bank run, the FDIC's meager action left many depositors unable to access funds for months, and uncertainty in the market began to exponentially escalate. Additionally, the 2024 election's unorthodox political alignments has only served to compound market worries. In terms of foreign affairs, the War in Ukraine has been ongoing for well over two years at this point, and conservatives and hardline left wingers are becoming restless.</p><p>The United States is dancing on a thread, any slight mistake will have brutal consequences.</p>\n",

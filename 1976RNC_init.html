What few of them didn't come skittering back to the Gipper searched desperately for a candidate to pick up the ex-veep's baton. Bob Dole isn't the one they wanted, but it's who they have. Dole doesn't wield vitriol with the effectiveness of an Agnew, a Wallace, or even a Helms or Tower, but he's angry enough for the base. To all the columnists prophesying doom, Dole merely quirks an eyebrow and lets out a mordant quip. Will it be enough to keep the flame burning another four years?</p>",

He has sold ''New Democrats'' as the antidote to the liberal losers of days gone by. He has bucked trend and broken tradition, just to settle the score. Fighting by his side stands Hillary, his political partner and wife, the only person in the world who sees through his cultivated charm.</p> <p>Clinton knows the establishment is cutthroat. Having campaigned on taming the beast, the President is now tasked with fulfilling the new covenant he promised to the country. If he can stand his ground, re-election should be easy. But public opinion is fickle — every bit as slippery as his own charm. He can already hear the cogs of the GOP smear machine gurgling to life. Even in these good times, the Big Dog must tread carefully to avoid being dragged into the mire of Washington, where the muck can swallow a man whole. </p>",

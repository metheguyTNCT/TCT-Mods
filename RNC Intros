He has sold ''New Democrats'' as the antidote to the liberal losers of days gone by. He has bucked trend and broken tradition, just to settle the score. Fighting by his side stands Hillary, his political partner and wife, the only person in the world who sees through his cultivated charm.</p> <p>Clinton knows the establishment is cutthroat. Having campaigned on taming the beast, the President is now tasked with fulfilling the new covenant he promised to the country. If he can stand his ground, re-election should be easy. But public opinion is fickle — every bit as slippery as his own charm. He can already hear the cogs of the GOP smear machine gurgling to life. Even in these good times, the Big Dog must tread carefully to avoid being dragged into the mire of Washington, where the muck can swallow a man whole. </p>",

For almost thirty years, he’s been at the heart of the Senate, just like he represents the state in the heart of America. Sarcastic, dour, stubborn, and never quite in step with the times, no matter the year. While others make roudy speeches to stir up crowds, Dole just scowls, folds his arms, makes a sardonic comment, and waits for the room to quiet down. He is not interested in tearing things down. America is great just the way it is— all it needs is some tinkering around the edges and a good bit of teamwork.</p> <p>But the world has moved on. His America— the honorable, decent, serious, straight talking one, where folks didn’t lie much about one another— is being buried beneath lies, debt, and a whole lot of shouting matches. His rivals see politics as bloodsport or spectacle. Dole sees it as a responsibility, even when it breaks you. So here he stands, a third of him paralyzed, another third mournful of what his party used to be, and the last part of him equipped with a helluva lot of quips. This is it. All or nothing. One last fight, for one last Republican.</p>",

A former economics professor, Gramm is a true believer in the gospel of the free market. He defected from the Democratic Party in 1983 for one reason— they wouldn’t let him cut enough. Now, decades later, he still sees Washington as an unrelenting beast of burden— and he wants to starve it until it surrenders. </p> <p>Gramm isn’t running for your heart. He isn’t running on sentimentality— or pornos, no matter what the media likes to say. He’s running for the budget. His plan? Flatten the tax code, hack apart entitlements, and pull America out of its national malaise with the power of discipline and deregulation. He doesn’t care about cultural crusades— although he’ll gladly partake in them if it means he can get away with more cuts— or populist rants about protectionism and the border; he’s here for the numbers alone. The press calls “Porno-Gramm” cold. Gramm just shrugs. You don’t have to warm up to a chainsaw. You just have to hold it steady and let it work.</p>",

You could write a book about the cinematography alone. Unfortunately, it falls short in accuracy, particularly regarding Thompson. If this series has a hero, it's him. He's portrayed as an honest man, completely out of the loop on Wilson's deceptions, and as the lone courageous voice in the administration—enough to stop him when he goes too far. Reality is significantly less flattering. Thompson knew full well what was going on, and his decision to stop Wilson was more to save his own skin than the country's. Just like his role in the Watergate hearings, Thompson and his supporters have been all too glad to rewrite and whitewash the history of his rise to the presidency.</li></ul>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<u><b>ClydeCash - 1 Star</b></u>\n<ul><li>Man, how the fuck did the Republicans ever win again after this shit LOL</li></ul>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<h2>\nExtras:\n</h2>\n\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cast interviews and behind-the-scenes clips.

For years, only Mario Lemieux was a viable challenger, and even then he never got close. But who else could have done it?\n</p>\n<p>\nEnter <strong>Alexander Ovechkin</strong>. Born on September 17th, 1985, he became known for his agile skating, clever play making, and devastating shooting. When a then teenager is able to go toe to toe with men years above his age, all while doing the little things that counts, <em>no wonder</em> agents were flocking to Ovechkin. \n</p>\n<p>\nEveryone’s familiar with the great expulsion of Soviet athletes on April 8th 1997. As part of a series of questionable legislation to quell “the domestic Soviet threat” president Colin Powell forced all Soviet nationals playing for American teams in the big four leagues to be forcibly deported. On June 17th, after months of legal pushback from the NHL with no end in sight, <strong>the league would never be the same. </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nOn that day, the NHL publicly announced that until the government softened their restrictions, or said players renounced their citizenship, <strong><em>Soviets were temporarily barred from the NHL. </em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nI cannot emphasize <em>enough</em> the impact this had on the NHL. Besides the <em>political implications</em> of mass deportation, star players like Pavel Bure, Alexander Mogilny, and the entire Russian 5 (Sergei Fedorov, Vladimir Konstantinov, Slava Kozlov, Slava Fetisov and Igor Larionov for those not in the know) had their primes wasted on a substanceless show of strength that never <strong>meaningfully</strong> did the thing it set out to do.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs a Black man himself, Powell should have known how his xenophobic policies capitalized on a wave of fear mongering and discrimination of ethnic Slavs in the US in the same way Jim Crow laws did for Black Americans. I will never forget when Jaromír Jágr, a Czech, was asked why he wasn’t deported too, simply because of his accent. \n</p>\n<p>\nAll of the slavophobia culminated in the Canada/Soviet Republic of Russia face off at the 1997 world championships. In a display of utter depravity, Soviet spectators furious at Powell’s reigniting of the Cold War, singled out similarly Black Canadian Jarome Iginla, hurling the N-word every time he entered the ice. The Canadian team had enough after the 2nd half of the 2nd period, initiating a full on line brawl that sprawled out between the two teams. For 9 whole minutes. It’s only fitting that with the rebirth of the Soviets, so too would there be another Punch-up in Piestany, all warts attached. Anyways, enough of <em>my own </em>political opinions, <strong>back to the story. </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nSaid temporary restriction stayed all the way until <em>2002</em>, when in anticipation for the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, a new arrangement for Soviet athletes was finally brokered between the NHL and Powell’s vice Don Nickles. Soviet nationals were back on NHL ice, but with a catch. Any athlete, new and old, <strong>had to comply with visa restrictions and pass background checks for any state ties to the Soviet government</strong>, known for using star players as political propaganda machines. \n</p>\n<p>\nIf they didn’t comply or pass, the only options left echoed the previous policy. <strong>Renounce citizenship, or say goodbye to any NHL dreams. </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nBetween agent and government interviews, for its 2004 draft, the hockey world held its breath to see which team could have the fortune to draft a <strong>once in a lifetime opportunity.</strong> The Washington Capitals were gunning for Ovi. <em>The Washington Agencies had other plans.</em> It’s rumoured that things went south for the then 19 year old following a confrontation about the visitation clause. In an alleged altercation, the Soviet reportedly cursed at government interviewers for <em>“banning right to return to motherland (sic).”</em> His fate was sealed shortly afterwards. \n</p>\n<p>\nOn May 23rd, 2004, the NHL made a press release that <strong>Alexander Ovechkin had failed security checks</strong>, and was <strong>no longer eligible</strong> for the 2004 entry level draft. \n</p>\n<p>\nWith his expulsion, <strong>one of hockey’s greatest what ifs was born.</strong> The legend of Alexander Ovechkin, a great hypothetical that never truly sprung into fruition, limited by circumstances beyond his own. While the Soviets of the 80s never got close to setting foot in North America, one must wonder, had President Powell not expelled all Soviet players, or had Ovechkin complied with visa restrictions placed onto him, <em>would this story be different? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The facts speak for themselves.</strong> Even as one of the few international duels featuring Alexander the Great unfurls beneath our eyes in the form of the 2010 Olympics, it’s ever increasingly clear the comparisons to Mario Lemieux are more than well founded. Ovi reaches impossibly high scores and points in the KHL he’s made home, and helms a dominant multi-year gold streak at the world championships. Ovechkin makes plays left, right and centre, and who could forget his explosive shot that has goaltenders flinching every time he gets a whiff of the puck? \n</p>\n<p>\nI’d like to think if Ovi did make it, he does well. Exceptionally well. Perhaps he wins the franchise’s first cup or two, or even three while we’re at it. Maybe #32 for the Capitals breaks team records, or even <em>league records!</em> With his generational talent, his number would certainly be hung among the Caps rafters. \n</p>\n<p>\nUnfortunately, things didn’t turn out that way. We can deliberate all we want about changing minute details for a want of a nail, but what is said is said, done is done, and just like Lemieux, <strong>Alexander Ovechkin will forever remain the great one that never was. </strong>\n</p>`",

No, instead it's a time for me to remember the 1970s, where a bloated alcoholic stumbled and bumbled his way into the halls of power. It was a time of Hunter Thompsons and Spiro Agnews, a time for rage and hate directed against evil, and the only dispute is what evil is.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn his obituary for President Nixon, Thompson said of Nixon: \"(He) was an evil man -- evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the Devil can understand it. He was utterly without ethics or morals or any bedrock sense of decency.\" This is true of Dick Cheney. In his screeds across the nation, Spiro Agnew in Harrisburg described how \"Neither the greedy nor the malicious but the self-righteous who are guilty of history's worst atrocities... evil cloaked in emotional causes is well disguised and undiscovered until it is too late... they pervert honest concerns into something sick and rancid... Their interest is personal, not moral. They are ideological eunuchs.\" That is true of Dick Cheney.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut where the jackbooted thug Agnew shrieked about ‘’National Masochism’’, Dick Cheney believed in national martyrdom. Not for himself, who impregnated his wife twice to dodge the draft, but for the ignorant men and women who believed their public servants had their best interests in mind. He believed that the poor shouldn't depend on welfare, because it created dependency and burdened the taxpayers, and the taxpayer would be far better off paying to kill people hundreds of miles away who posed no threat to them.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you asked Dick Cheney if he wanted to create a safer nation for his lesbian daughter or a more violent world with slaughter and pillaging and rape, he would tell you that he is creating a safer nation by tearing up peace treaties and creating a thousand new Osama Bin Ladens. He would happily work under men like Ronald Reagan and George H.W Bush, who sat back and watched as gay men died in the streets, and happily shake hands with repugnant bigots like Pat Robertson or his Henrich Himmler Donald Rumsfeld, in order to slaughter and pillage. \n</p>\n<p>\nIt is tempting to call him heartless. But he wasn't. He was a true believer in dumping shit in the rivers and saving nations by killing their people, by re-creating World War Two and pissing on the \"coalition of the willing\", on supporting his gay daughter while partnering with a man who used her sexuality as a method of securing voter loyalty by demonising it. He wasn't heartless because after heart attack number 5, he managed to snag a heart on the transplant list in 2005. I wonder how many people died so this monster could enjoy 15 years of his legacy being verbally attacked by Joe Biden and Chris Christie, while practically upheld by the \"adults in the room\" as the only way of maintaining American credibility that he had worked tirelessly to destroy.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he wasn't metaphorically heartless either. True, he valued murder over his daughter, but to his old friends? The taxpayer shouldn't pay for things like retirement, healthcare, or health and safety standards enforcement. But to his old friends in the oil industry? To Haliburton? Crack open your wallet or go to prison, as is the typical social contract. He was a criminal. In a just world, he would have been given an electric chair, after his fat ass broke the noose they would use to put him to death. \n</p>\n<p>\nThere is no hell deep, black and burning enough for this monster. It is tempting to recount May 19th, 2020 as a day of rare joy in difficult times, because it is a day that a demon returned to hell. But he died at peace, surrounded by loved ones, and soon to be fellated by a political establishment that pretended to hate him when they in truth were him. He and his merry band of Neo-Cons never faced justice beyond being unpopular for a few years.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe was filth. Unremarkable filth.\n</p>",

Stage lights are dimmed, with a faint yellow spotlight facing down towards THE PRESIDENT. He sits in front of the resolute, TURNED AWAY FROM THE CAMERA and facing the window, centered in frame. The camera slowly zooms into a medium shot. THE PRESIDENT is frustrated at something. Or more precisely, someONE. THE PRESIDENT waits after the audience reacts before speaking. \n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n<strong>THE PRESIDENT</strong>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\nYes. Yes, I know.

If he wants Edwards in my office, that’s not my issue.\n</p>\n<p>\nTHE PRESIDENT TURNS AROUND, revealing his identity as SONNY BONO. Yes, the actual president, the actual SONNY BONO. The audience erupts with cheers for the popular and beloved President. \n</p>\n<p>\nAn INTERN, 20s to 30s, WALKS IN. They’re just starting out, and try their best to keep their nervousness in check.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n<strong>INTERN</strong>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n(EAGER TO PLEASE) Mr President, the Coffee you ordered–\n</p>\n<p>\nIn barges the Vice President GEORGE VOINOVICH, played by Will Ferrell. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe INTERN is shocked by his arrival, and clumsily SPILLS THE COFFEE all over BONO’s beautiful suit and face.

<p>
<i>The Washington Post</i>

October 27th 2002

<p>
Ten years ago, in the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse, most folks assumed the space race was over for good. But under President Gingrich, and with China rising, that assumption has begun to fallen apart. Now both the People’s Republic of China and the United States have escalated their missions in space, in what U.S. journalists have been dubbing “the new space race.” In recent weeks, it’s started to look less like headline-chasing and more like an emerging geopolitical focal point of this young century.
</p>
<p>
In back-to-back announcements, the two powers confirmed that their first semi-permanent outposts at the lunar south pole have moved from construction trials to ''initial operating capability,'' in NASA’s words. According to senior officials and industry insiders who spoke off the record, a joint mission of 10 Americans, 3 Canadians, and a handful of top recruits from various EU and U.S.-aligned countries will head to the ''Neil A. Armstrong Lunar Base.'' Meanwhile, the People’s Republic of China intends to send a similar complement of Chinese, Russian, Brazilian, and Pakistani personnel to the rival ''Yutu Station,'' just a hundred or so miles from the U.S.-led base, with apparent plans involving Nigeria, South Africa, Cuba, and North Korea to assist their program, and an eventual promise that recruits from those countries will join the mission.
</p>
<p>
President Gingrich, who has spent much of his second term defending higher NASA spending and a web of public–private contracts, seized on the twin announcements to claim vindication of what many had dismissed as science-fiction baloney. Speaking from the South Lawn to a pack of reporters, he called the lunar outposts ''the logical frontier for a free civilization'' and warned that ''if America doesn’t plant its flag and its values there first, others will.'' Aides and unnamed sources in the White House say Gingrich is working day and night to press Congress to protect and even increase space funding in the face of the post-recession squeeze, and many of them concede that today’s remarks were aimed more at skeptical Republicans than at Beijing, especially those who still see NASA’s expansion as a Gingrich vanity project.
</p>
<p>
Both projects are being sold at home as the fruits of their respective economic systems: to the Chinese, a monument to the deliberation and strength of the Communist Party; and to the Americans, a monument to the great American industrial and scientific model, and, for both, a stepping stone toward Mars, the rest of the planetary system, and beyond. If the 20th century’s contest played out in Berlin and Cuba, the 21st may just play out on a sunless rim of the moon, or on the rust-red terrain of Mars.

There is no other way to put it. We have been consumed by a gaping, irreconcilable anger, engulfing our media and our art as would a maelstrom, a ship stranded out at sea. The cultural zeitgeist of our once great nation, over these past few years, has shifted into an interminable echo chamber of the same commercialized faux-cynicism repeated over and over again to a nauseating degree. Every day I find myself confronted with yet another false Moses, claiming to have found the answer to gun violence or homelessness or greed or capitalism or politics, all for it to just be, once more, nothing but vitriolic bile and sensationalist hyperbole disguised as a ‘realist’s interpretation of the truth’. All of this hate, however, and none of it truly in the face of the unchecked voracity of a power-hungry, callous corporate destruction of our public services and Democratic system.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat is why, in this environment, when one finds true artistic expression, it is euphoric. \n</p>\n<p>\nWhat I am referencing is the recent piece of political satire, ‘Letter Of A Lover’, which has been widely circulated online as of late. Within it is contained what may be one of the most earnestly blunt pieces of modern writing I have read this year. This is rageful in a sense. Yet it is rage with a purpose. One that does not claim to provide a solution. Only to critique that which stands in the way of one. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe key dynamic of the piece, the relationship between the two Bills, is brilliant. Their love affair is used as a means by which to both highlight the failures of their administrations and to scathingly critique the two men, especially in their capacity as leaders. It is a torrid, broken affair; yet, much like in the story of genesis, the two are brought back to the forbidden fruit of their irresistible, corrosive love. \n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, one of the most intriguing parts of the work to me is the characterization.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe fact is, the character of Weld is portrayed in a manner simultaneously exaggerated and pointedly accurate. He is cowardly. He is wracked by a sense of despair. He is anxious. His stress and fear are projected outwards towards others, manifesting in a bumbling, emotional man, with a slightly pathetic disposition towards self-deprecation and insecurity. In truth, this image of Weld, as a man wracked not so much by wickedness, but rather weakness, may be more accurate than the portrait of a cold-hearted creature of political delinquency we see purported by the major pundits of what remains of legacy liberal media.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhilst this is obviously written from the perspective of Weld early on in his tenure, it is clear that there is little that has changed in the man over these torrid past 6 years. Observe his response to the Columbine hostage crisis 5 years ago, and his reaction to the LA bombings only a month fresh in this nation’s scarred mind. In both cases, he floundered, equivocated and stalled in an increasingly deteriorating mental state, until pressured by advisors to launch a botched intervention costing the lives of hundreds of Americans. He did not federalize the California National Guard in an act of strength; rather, it was in a desperate attempt to escape the supreme feeling of inadequacy which aides describe Weld as having possessed ever since he entered the White House. His relationship with Bill brings no different ails.\n</p>\n<p>\nClinton’s character, in contrast, is presented as ambiguous in his moral constitution; he bears no defining mark of evil, and brings with him no great indicator of good. This was much the case throughout his Presidency, and, as he edges ever closer to the shrinking circles of power Weld now surrounds himself with, it has become clear that the spectre of this snake oil salesman will not be exorcised from the highest office in the land anytime soon.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe recent press conference between Clinton and Weld should be only yet another stark indicator of how apt this piece is. Weld has not broken with Clinton or his failures in the slightest. He has continued cravenly on the blazing course of deconstructing the American social construct and remaking the American global order into a new machine of silent imperialism. Their personal friendship which has seemingly blossomed since the 1996 election should not be a surprise to anybody; the two men are both, in their own right, sickly embodiments of decadence and Western hubris. They find comfort and vindication in the fact that their broken status quo has a supporter in the form of the only type of person who matters to the political class; a fellow officeholder, acquainted to the struggles and mental contortion that come with the position.\n</p>\n<p>\nI doubt that America, much like Weld, will ever escape the shadow of Clinton. The Democratic Party has collapsed into infighting after their calamity in the 2000 contingent election, all whilst under the thumb of a party apparatus still morbidly enamoured with the former President. The Reform Party is proving unable to sustain itself as a cohesive entity, even in the face of the encroaching ‘Uniparty’ they once warned of becomes an immanent reality. The newly formed ‘American Liberty Party’ offers no solution, its voice only melting into the violence and spite of the political scene. There seems to be no further respite for our current system.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut I digress. This is a review of a niche piece of writing online, not another one of those manifestos from a false prophet I so decried in the opening stages of this article. I will not encourage you to do anything further than read the original work in all its scathing beauty. And to the artistically inclined amongst you; if you still have a desire to rise above the noise, take notes. This is how one does it.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou can read ‘Letter of a Lover’ <a href=\"https://file.garden/Zsz7wL96OyyJ2oZe/Hope%20Misc/LetterOfALover.txt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>:\n<p>\nRead More From Kirk McLean:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>Why Al Gore Does Not Care About You</li>\n\n<li>The Truth Behind the Detroit Riots</li>\n\n<li>How The Government Hides the Truth of the Akron Extraterrestrial Sightings</li>\n\n<li>President Weld Should Read the Great Gatsby\n",

Besides a little pushback from Perot and the Midwest, the agreement sees almost universal approval. You're taking some credit from 41 as well, who really got the ground running for this, so that's a plus.

You've done what George Bush couldn’t—signed NAFTA, complete with the few labor and environmental side accords your team insisted on. Sure, wackos like Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan, and Ralph Nader will complain, but they’re distractions from the old world. Who cares? You’ve got bigger fish to fry.

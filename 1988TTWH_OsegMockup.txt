            "description": "<p>Dick Thornburgh is the current governor of Pennsylvania. On the more moderate side of the Republican party, Dick could expand the ticket's appeal and separate the party's image from the failings of the Reagan administration. Thornburgh has also gained a reputation for being tough on crime which can certainly help with the recent influx of riots as of late. Dick is also known for his work on welfare reform and job creation, and gained national praise for his work to ensure emergency response efforts during the partial nuclear power plant meltdown on Three Mile Island.</p><p>Overall, Dick is an experienced, uncontroversial pick, which given your tendency to be somewhat the opposite, might just be for the best.</p>",

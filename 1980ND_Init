Four decades have passed since the first New Deal acts, and now they lie severely weakened, by two decades of Republican executives, and the rising fiscal conservatism of the Democrats. However as the nation enters the next decade, the winds blow toward great change to come.</p><p>For the past four years president Anderson has lead the nation. Despite his overwhelming victory against Connally in 76, due to the Rose Garden Scandal, the times have not looked kindly on his presidency. He has overseen through the rise of a recession, the second oil crisis, a rise in poverty, a rise in crime, and the news of hostages in revolutionary Iran. With these issues not yet solved, it appears the electorate may not keep Anderson around longer than his predecessor.</p><p>Two decades of Republicanism has Thoroughly changed the Democratic party. The old New Deal coalition now lies divided on the lines of civil rights, and the Connally administration has only further divided the north from the south. However with him now gone, the party must now choose between the two frontrunners that were denied in 72 and 76. With the dawn of the new decade, and victory surely certain, the party now moves into its time for choosing.</p>",

Early in the campaign it had looked like the Purple parties, aside from D66, were going to repeat 1998 and win convincingly. Fortuyn and the party he led (first Livable Netherlands, then the Pim Fortuyn List) then came out of nowhere and caused the both of them to fall rapidly in the polls. And then, a week before the election, he was murdered. Political assassinations hadn't taken place since World War II.</p><p>With his success, Fortuyn essentially ushered in the end of the three-pronged nature of our politics. With his list, following his assassination the second largest party of the country, the dominance of the big three: CDA, PvdA and VVD, was definitively put under pressure. Multiple other parties have entered the top three since then. The rise of a multitude of right-wing parties that explode onto the national scene, like had happened with the PVV, FvD and BBB, can also be regarded as a Fortuynist tradition that started in 2002. In that way, the pivotal and dramatic election of 2002 very much set the stage for our political situation today.</p>\", \"has_visits\": 0, \"no_electoral_majority_image\": \"https://files.catbox.moe/14hg6p.png\"}}]");

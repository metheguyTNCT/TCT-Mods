            "description": "<h3 class=\"tv-title\">Laying In State</h3><p><em>History echoed between the marble columns of the Capitol Rotunda.</em> President Nixon stood in the shadows, watching as the line of mourners shuffled forward, past the casket draped in the stars and stripes. The great beast himself—Lyndon Baines Johnson—was finally at rest.</p><p>He let his eyes drift to Lady Bird, the ever-loyal soldier, standing ramrod straight despite the weight of a grief that Nixon suspected was heavier than anyone knew. He knew—oh, he knew—how Johnson had gone. An empty house, a body found before the press could get wind of it. The story carefully sculpted, just like everything else about the man’s final days. And now the Johnsons wouldn’t let history have the truth. So neither would Dick.</p><p>And yet here they were, the same men who had howled for Johnson’s blood, who called him a butcher, a crook, a tyrant. Now they wept into their handkerchiefs, spoke of his “great service,” of his “commitment to the Union,” of his “undaunted courage.” If there was one thing Nixon had learned in all his years, it was that Americans had no patience for failure, but every last one of them adored a fallen man.</p><p><em>Lose like a bum, and they'll trample you.</em><br><em>Die like a king, and they’ll name a damn airport after you.</em></p><p>He had beaten him. Not just beaten him—annihilated him. Not one. The cowboy couldn’t hold his own ranch. And now Nixon was king, as sure as day followed night, and the Democrats were in chaos, stumbling over each other to find a standard-bearer for November. He just needed them to fail a little more. Just one more time. Then he’d be untouchable.</p><p>The thought was warming, intoxicating. He let it settle over him, basking in the absolute finality of his triumph.</p><p>Still, there was a part of him—that felt something almost like admiration. For all the bastard’s faults, for all his blunders, Johnson had been a fighter. An SOB, sure, but a fighter. He had climbed and clawed and connived his way to the top, earned his seat at the table. And for a man like that, a man who lived politics, breathed it, bled it—losing like that must have been worse than death.</p><p><em>And maybe that’s why he took the gun.</em></p><p>Nixon gave one last look at the casket, at the crowds, at Lady Bird’s immovable stance. He adjusted his tie, straightened his jacket. He had work to do. Another landslide awaited.</p></div></div>`);\n",

The lights flickered with an electric hum, casting creeping, murky shadows along the peeling walls. In the bunk across from him, a man sat in silence, head lowered—the type who knew better than to ask too many questions. That was fine by him.</p><p>Hoffa leaned back, a slow smirk stretching across his face as he exhaled through his nose. The news had arrived just hours ago—Bobby Kennedy was finished. The bastard had gone down, just like he always knew he would.</p><p>He dragged a hand through his thick hair, fingers tapping against his temple as he chuckled, low and satisfied. <em>\"What’d I tell ya, huh? You play too many fuckin’ enemies at once, you think you're some kinda fuckin’ golden boy, and before you know it—boom—you’re eatin’ dirt. Kid thought he was untouchable. But nobody’s untouchable. Certainly not a fuckin’ Kennedy.\"</em></p><p>He spat on the floor and cracked his knuckles, slow and deliberate, one at a time. <em>\"He should count himself one lucky sonofabitch, though. At least he gets to walk away. If this was real justice, he’d be layin’ six feet under, like his brother, seeing the inside of a casket instead of some goddamn Senate seat.\"</em> He shook his head, exhaling sharply. <em>\"But it’s fine. He’s out. He’s done. That’s all that matters.\"</em></p><p>The words rolled out like a victory toast he couldn’t yet drink. He had worked hard for this moment, manoeuvring from behind bars, passing messages, pulling strings, making sure the right people got the right calls. He might be inside, but he was never out of the game. And Nixon? Nixon understood how the game worked.</p><p><em>\"See, Nixon’s a real man,\"</em> he said, rolling his shoulders. <em>\"He may be in politics but he sees it the right way. What matters is power, and who’s got it. And let me tell you somethin’, I got it. I still got it. And once I walk outta here—and believe me, that’s gonna be real soon—I go right back where I belong. Back to business, back to the real life.\"</em></p><p>Frank remained silent.</p><p>Hoffa snorted, shaking his head. <em>\"What, you ain’t got nothin’ to say? What, you think little Bobby’s sittin’ somewhere cryin’ into his drink, beggin’ his father for another handout, wonderin’ how Hoffa pulled one over on him!?\"</em> He let out a laugh, short and sharp. <em>\"That’s the thing about these rich-boy types. They got all the money in the world, all the connections, but they never learned how to fight dirty. Not like us. You and me. The people that built this country. You, me and Nixon.\"</em></p><p>The quiet stretched between them, but Hoffa barely noticed Frank’s stillness. He was too busy picturing his return—the headlines, the men lined up to shake his hand again, to beg for forgiveness.</p><p>Then, a shift. The slightest movement from Frank in the dim light.</p><p class=\"ending-quote\">And the wire slipped around Jimmy’s throat.</p></div></div>",

Dear God, how she had tried, pleading with him to see reason.</em></p><p>Eight years had passed since that night in ’68 when they sat side by side, watching the returns come in, knowing it was slipping away from them. She had held his hand as he smiled for the cameras, as he congratulated Nixon through a forced smile, as he told the world that he wasn’t finished—that they couldn’t get rid of him. Most assumed he was joking. Muriel knew better.</p><p>So here they were again, back on the trail, chasing a long-dead dream, withering away while younger men—more vigorous men—left them in the dust. Kennedy, Udall... even Mondale wasn’t holding his hat for Hubert anymore.</p><p>She shifted her weight, pressing her gloved hands together for warmth. She knew why he was doing this. <em>He couldn’t live his life in the shadow forever.</em> He needed to reclaim his manhood, and he felt the only way he could do it was by taking the Presidency. <em>It was killing him, eating him from the inside, haunted by ghosts.</em></p><p>The crowd gently clapped. Hubert always had supporters, especially out here, but the latest polling was still stagnant. In a week, this would be over, and the two of them would be back home again.</p><p>Hubert’s voice rang out, strained, squeezing out his last words as his breath drew short. <em>\"This is our time! We have work to do, my friends, and I am ready to lead!\"</em></p><p>Muriel forced a smile, clapping politely, watching as her husband smiled under the dimming winter sun, his grey wispy hair dragged across his scalp.</p><p>The cancer was there. <em>They both knew it, though they didn’t speak of it.</em> He tried to hide it from her, but he was a terrible liar.</p><p>She watched him now, taking in the scene, willing herself to remember him this way—standing tall, smiling wide, shaking hands and kissing babies, laughing that great booming laugh that made people believe everything was going to be okay.</p><p><em>She wanted to take his hand and tell him it was enough.

Outside, the late afternoon sun cast blotchy shadows through the leaves of the trees and lace curtains. <em>Until the world looked like it was painted in polka dots.</em></p><p>Then, she saw them.</p><p>Through the front window, across the quiet suburban street, a government car rolled to a stop on her street.

It had happened exactly as he had feared, as he had told him it would happen. A truly embarrassing night for the party, a slaughter so complete it left the old bulls of the Senate shaken, speaking in hushed voices about what would come next. For Russell, there was no need for discussion. He knew. He had known for years. This was the natural consequence of Johnson’s arrogance, his foolish overreach. He had warned him, again and again. Push too far, and the country will push back harder. And by God, had they ever.</p><p>He poured himself a drink, the ice clinking as he leaned back in his chair, eyes settling on the rotary phone perched on the desk. He knew the call was coming. Just a matter of when.</p><p>It came just past midnight. Russell let it ring twice, then picked up.</p><p>\"Well,\" he said, keeping his voice even, measured. \"I expect you’re calling with an apology.\"</p><p>A dry chuckle from the other end, bitter and ragged. \"That what you want to hear, Uncle Dick?\" Johnson’s voice was thick, weighed down by exhaustion, by something heavier still.</p><p>\"It’s what I ought to hear,\" Russell replied. \"You took this party straight to hell, son. You dragged it kicking and screaming, and now you’ve left it in ruins.\"</p><p>There was silence. Russell could hear faint breathing, the sound of ice shifting in a glass.</p><p>\"Well, when you’re right, you’re right Uncle Dick\" Johnson said finally. His voice wavered, quieter than Russell had ever heard it. \"They hated me. I thought… I thought I could bring ‘em around. Thought if I just did enough…\"</p><p>His voice began to buckle. \"But they wanted me gone—hell, they made sure I was gone.\"</p><p>Russell shut his eyes. Damn it all. He should have been relishing this, should have taken some satisfaction in knowing he had been right from the beginning. But there was no pleasure in hearing the President of the United States reduced to this.</p><p>\"It’s over, son,\" he said, softer now. \"Ain’t no use cryin’ over it. The people made their choice. And you—you did what you thought was right.\"</p><p>Johnson let out a shaky breath. \"They’ll undo it all, won’t they?\" His voice was distant, hoarse.</p><p>Russell exhaled, rubbing his temple. \"Maybe,\" he admitted. \"Maybe not. But you don’t get to decide that anymore.\"</p><p>Another silence, longer this time. Then, so softly Russell almost missed it: \"It’s not our time anymore.\"</p><p>\"Look. Get some rest, son,\" Russell said. \"That’s what you do first. Get some rest. You’re still President after all.\"</p><p>Johnson didn’t argue. The line went silent.</p><p>Russell sat there for a long time, staring at the phone, listening to the empty hum of the receiver before it finally clicked.</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"ending-slide\"><div class=\"tv-fade\"><h3 class=\"tv-title\">Flower Power</h3><p>The wind cut like a knife through the streets of Washington. ‘It was too fucking cold,’ Abbie thought to himself, stuffing his hands deeper into the pockets of his army surplus coat. The protest was happening, but you wouldn’t know it from the television cameras. Though they stood only a few blocks away, they might as well have been on the other side of the planet. Instead, all the cameras were locked on the spectacle of Richard Nixon and John Lindsay taking their oaths of office, utterly ignorant of the thousands freezing in the parks and on the sidewalks. The election was over. The country had made its choice. This was not Chicago. There were no helicopters buzzing overhead, no clubs crashing down on skulls. The police were disciplined, restrained—keeping the freaks well away from the festivities.</p><p>The unkempt horde shuffled well behind the barriers. Yippies, Panthers, Maoists, anarchists—bundled up and restless. Crude signage whipped violently in the wind, the free-spirited ‘revolutionary youth’ snowbound. Someone had managed to set up a microphone, and there he was, Abbie himself, stepping up onto a shaky platform, the wind whipping his curls, glistening with fresh snowdrops. He grabbed the mic, and with a deep breath, he let it rip.</p><p><em>\"Come all you rebel youth spirits, rock minstrels, bomb throwers, bank robbers, poets, street folk, liberated women, professors and body snatchers! Let’s build a new world! Don’t buy in to their goddamn jackass-elephant circus!\"</em></p><p>The crowd roared, but the energy was different. The energy that permeated last year had been thoroughly tapped. Even the cops, those blue-blazed pigs, weren’t interested in beating the snot out of them—more concerned with coddling cups of coffee. The whole world wasn’t watching, the machine was learning, the media’s narrative didn’t include them anymore, and walking away from the microphone, Abbie couldn’t help but wonder—would it ever again?</p><p>Abbie spied Tom Hayden sat on a cold patch of grass, watching a much larger crowd of Nixon supporters gather on the National Mall, and Abbie joined him as they sat back on a damp path, watching as the system lumbered forward and the world kept turning.</p><p><em>\"Thinking of going over there?\"</em> asked Abbie, pointing to the inaugural attendees. <em>“I’m sure you’ll fit right in over there?”</em> It was only half a joke.</p><p>Tom smirked, <em>\"I’m sure you’d be much happier over there too. You might even be able to squeeze an arrest out of it. That’ll really show Nixon.\"</em></p><p><em>“Is that why you think I’m here?”</em> Abbie responded. <em>“Because I thought this was supposed to be a protest, to show these bastards that we’re not going to stop.”</em></p><p>Tom was done. <em>“Maybe they don’t want us to stop. Maybe we’re the distraction. And those people over there,”</em> he pointed to the growing crowd, <em>“they’re the only people that really matter.”</em></p><p>A voice cracked through the loudspeaker, bouncing off the stone walls and aimlessly into the breeze. <em>\"Free chicken and ice cream in the streets! Thousands of kazoos! Drums! Tambourines! Pots and pans! Trumpets! Firecrackers! We’ll drown out this farce with the sound of real America!\"</em></p><p>Abbie let out a bitter laugh. <em>\"I used to think you were smart, Tom. We’re here because we have to be. Because Nixon or Johnson or Wallace—they need to know they can’t keep killing us and expect us to do nothing. That no matter what they say, or who they are—until the killing ends, we’ll still be here pissing on their parade.\"</em></p><p>Tom shrugged. <em>\"At least there’s a chance. The war—he could end it.\"</em></p><p>Abbie’s voice softened, just for a moment. <em>\"The last time I believed, I voted for Lyndon Johnson.\"</em></p><p class=\"ending-quote\">The country wasn’t ending today. It wasn’t even changing. And that, more than anything, made Abbie sick.</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<h3 class=\"tv-title\">Hell’s Hole</h3><p>John awoke to the same steady, drip, drip, drip as he had managed to fall asleep to. The ceiling of his cell was stained a sickly bubonic blotchy black, the humid air thick with the ever-present stench of rot and rust, and he was certain that his own stench by now was far worse. His bones ached as he shifted on the wooden plank that served as his bed, the cold metal cuffs around his ankles stung a little more with every passing second. The dim light drip, drip, dripping through the bars, the days drip, drip, dripping into each other, pooling until he couldn’t tell how long it had been.</p><p>It had been like this for as long as he could remember. The waiting. Always waiting. It was excruciating; it would go on so long that you would beg for anything to break it up. Until you would finally get your wish. And then the physical torture would commence. He had lost count of how many times he had been dragged from this cell, arms twisted behind his back, head forced low. But even as he was contorted and twisted just so, to ensure that even a twitch would strike a chord of pain, in between those moments he couldn’t stop torturing himself.</p><p>There were things he had said, things he had given up, things he could never take back. And that knowledge gnawed at him more than his numbing ankles or twisted vertebrae could. When he first arrived, he swore to keep his oath. It was one he couldn’t keep—and for what? Still they would come. They always came again. And there was so little left to hold onto.</p><p>Tran arrived at the usual time, or at least John assumed it was the usual time, stepping into the cell and out of the shadow with an air of indifference. He carried a tin cup of watery rice, setting it down right beside his head as the other guard—John didn’t know his name—unshackled the ankle bracelets.</p><p><em>\"Eat,\"</em> Tran said, as he always did. McCain ignored him, as he always did.</p><p>The questioning began soon after. Tran’s voice was level, almost conversational. <em>\"Tell me again, Lieutenant Commander, about your father. The admiral. Tell me about the war.\"</em></p><p>McCain ran a hand through his hair, noticing the strands of gray creeping in at his temples. He had only been here a year, but his body was aging in fast motion, breaking down under the strain. He clenched his jaw, refusing to answer.</p><p>He had seen it happen to others. He had felt it happening to himself. He had fought the doubt, fought the shame, but sometimes, in the dead of night, he wondered if he had already lost.</p><p>Tran sighed, lighting a cigarette, letting the silence stretch between them. <em>\"You are stubborn. It will not serve you here. If you cooperated more, things would be better.\"</em></p><p>McCain said nothing, and instead concentrated on the rice, counting every grain, as loudly as he could, without saying a word.</p><p>Tran exhaled slowly. <em>\"Perhaps it will not matter. Perhaps soon, you will be free.\"</em></p><p>McCain said nothing, stared deeply into the cup.</p><p>Tran took a slow drag of his cigarette. <em>\"Richard Nixon is now your President.\"</em></p><p class=\"ending-quote\">McCain let out a dry chuckle, shaking his head. <em>\"You must think I’m pretty stupid to believe that one.\"</em></p></div></div>",

            "description": "<h3 class=\"tv-title\">Hot Off the Presses</h3><p><em>\"And who did you vote for?\"</em> It was a cool prank that Katherine loved to play every four years. Even more so on her underlings—she adored watching them try to wriggle out of the little verbal trap she had laid, understanding perfectly that no journalist or editor worth their salt could afford to give a real answer. And certainly not to the most influential woman in the whole news industry.</p><p><em>\"Well … I don’t like to … my wife and I don’t discuss politics in public, she says it’s not polite,\"</em> said the young man, who worked to pour some scotch and soda into his mouth, hoping to avoid another question.</p><p><em>\"My, you’re secretive, gentlemen—I believe we’ve found the Wallace supporter amongst us,\"</em> she said, eliciting the polite laughter of her patrons, attendees of the Graham election night party. <em>\"There’s no need to play coy here. Believe you me, the more you try to hide it, the more people are dying to know. Whereas ask the same question to me and you’ll get a straight answer: I’m all the way with LBJ.\"</em> She gently clinked her glass with several others.</p><p>It was a curious kind of soirée on a very curious night. Any Washington party inevitably turned into a who’s who, and even on election night, Republicans, Democrats, and of course newspaper publishers intermingled, teasing one another. Katherine viewed such events as a healthy venture, a sign of a healthy democracy—that bitter rivals could eat and drink together without the butter knives being lodged in anyone’s backs.</p><p>But tonight was a different kind of night. In ’64 it was a damn sure thing—the Goldwater gang had thrown in the towel before the cocktails could be served and the presses of the Washington Post were already streaming out the pre-written pieces. And in ’60? Well, Philip had been managing things back then.</p><p><em>\"Y’know, I must have told this story a thousand times, but if tonight isn’t the night I’ll tell it again: Philip was the person who told Jack Kennedy he just had to pick Lyndon. He said, ‘Jack, you’ve got to go with Johnson’—to put personality aside and think of the bigger picture.\"</em> She swirled through the room in an evening dress, her assistant feeding her updates via a landline in the room over.</p><p>After a while, it became hard for Katherine—hardly a poker player—to hide her own anxiety, twirling one of the pearls in her necklace as she confronted the news of Nixon’s improving chances.</p><p><em>\"Now nothing’s certain, Katherine,\"</em> said Ben, the Post’s new executive editor, who had begun to attend these events as if it were written into his contract. <em>\"It’s been a rough year for the President.\"</em></p><p><em>\"Oh, some things are certain, Benjamin. The sun will rise in the morning, rivers will flow to the sea, and Lyndon Johnson will be re-elected. What is it that Lincoln said—never trade horses in the middle of the stream? And that’s what this war is—a mighty stream.\"</em> The cheery grace she had at the night’s beginning had evaporated, replaced with the cold matriarch. <em>\"And it would be unbecoming for a country to not recognize the President’s depth of devotion.\"</em></p><p>Her aide was gesturing to the phone now, but just for the moment—just for a few seconds—she chose to delay things. <em>\"And whatever difficulties he’s faced, win or lose, as a country we owe him a great level of gratitude.\"</em></p><p class=\"ending-quote\">She began that walk from the living room to the hallway, gripping the phone in one hand and her drink in the other, twisting the cord into knots.</p></div></div>\n",

            "description": "<h3 class=\"tv-title\">On Diplomacy</h3><p>The phones rang, unanswered. The secretaries, once cordial, now gave vague excuses or transferred him into an endless loop of extensions that led in circles. The Doctor’s patience eroded with every tick of the clock. The campaign was over, the election settled, and Henry Kissinger had backed the wrong horse.</p><p>It was only a few offhand comments, many months ago, that he had said Johnson was being <em>\"prematurely written off\"</em> and that the Republican Party looked poised to renominate Nixon—who was bound to self-destruct. A momentary lapse in judgment, and now Kissinger was about to be frozen out, while these ego-stroking morons were about to take the reins and steer the country off a cliff.</p><p>Kissinger couldn’t sleep. The thought of those buffoons inhabiting the White House gave him indigestion and killed his appetite. Desperate to save them from themselves, he pressed down on the receiver again to hear the same saccharine message:</p><p><em>\"I’m sorry, but Mr. Haldeman is unavailable at the moment. Would you like to leave a message?\"</em></p><p><em>\"No thank you, Miss,\"</em> he said politely. He had already left a message—he had left three goddamn messages—and all of them went unreturned.</p><p>These people had no idea the trouble they were wading into. Like apes who just got a hold of the nuclear codes, they needed someone in the room who could tame them. Nixon needed him—and now he had to read in the papers that Nixon was thinking of giving key positions to cowboys and loudmouths. Like it or not, Nixon needed him.</p><p>His soles ached from endless pacing. He rested for a moment to nurse his grieving feet, when the phone finally rang—a reply from the office of Charles Colson.</p><p><em>\"Henry,\"</em> Colson said, his tone dripping with smarm. <em>\"What can I do for you?\"</em></p><p>Kissinger inhaled sharply, already sensing the contempt lurking beneath the greeting. <em>\"I wanted to discuss my potential role in the administration. I believe the President-Elect will find my counsel invaluable. This is an administration that can’t afford to wait—there is a lot of ground to cover, given the dismal way Johnson has handled things.\"</em></p><p>There was no immediate response. Dead air hung between them. Then Colson let out a short, dry laugh. <em>\"You know, Henry, we’ve been talking about you. The consensus is that you’re a damn fine office intellectual, really—just top-notch. But this administration... it’s a team effort. And frankly, Henry, we’re not sure you’re exactly... on the team.\"</em></p><p>Kissinger clenched his fist, forcing his voice to remain even. <em>\"I have served the interests of this country tirelessly and would serve this President with that same level of dedication. Surely my record speaks for itself?\"</em></p><p>Colson sighed, the sound long and exaggerated, playing with Kissinger’s fate like a cat with string. <em>\"Well, we’ll see how things shake out. Maybe you’ll hear something soon.\"</em></p><p>Another click. Another dead end. Surely this couldn’t be it. It wouldn’t be. There were other avenues to go down. This presidency was going to go down in flames—Henry was certain of it. These men thought because they could fool half the country into voting for them, they could fool everyone else too.</p><p>But still he waited by the phone.</p><p>The waiting was excruciating.</p><p>An hour passed.</p><p>Then another.</p><p>Finally, the phone rang.</p><p><em>\"Dr. Kissinger, I have Haldeman on the line. He says he can spare a moment.\"</em></p><p>Kissinger exhaled, patting down sweat from his scalp as he climbed up off the floor and into his chair, composing himself. <em>\"Put him through.\"</em></p><p>He took a second, then calmly: <em>\"This is Dr. Kissinger.\"</em></p><p class=\"ending-quote\">Then Haldeman’s voice, smooth and unbothered: <em>\"Henry. The President-Elect has been asking about you.\"</em> Kissinger exhaled, allowing himself a silent smile. <em>\"I see.\"</em></p></div></div>",

You can thank me later.”</p><p>A pause. Then, in a low exhale, <em>“Jesus Christ, Gordon. What did you do?”</em></p><p>Liddy allowed himself a small, wolfish smile. “Nothing that can be traced.

He imagined the headlines, the dossiers, the operations yet to come. “I’ve got plans, John. A lot of plans.”</p><p>Ehrlichman sounded tired, resigned. “Look, Gordon, the campaign’s over.

McGovern’s loss was not only a political defeat; it was something deeper, something more existential. It was the confirmation that the forces of history were not moving forward in some linear, inevitable march toward progress. It was the understanding that all of it—the marches, the protests, the furious debates—could be undone by a single vote cast in quiet cowardice.</p><p>And yet, the faces of the Nixonettes shined with triumph.</p><p>In the span of months, the women’s movement had gone from a force to be reckoned with, which would conquer Washington, to a joke. To teenage girls, secretaries, housewives in red-white-and-blue sashes, their pleated skirts pressed just so, their lips painted the color of American virtue, screaming for a man who would never respect them. Cheerleaders for Nixon like it were just another hometown football game. And maybe that’s exactly what it was—one big pep rally for the patriarchy, a resounding victory for the very forces that told these women their highest achievement would be to stand on the sidelines and look pretty, and maybe pump out a baby or two in between trips to the nail salon.</p><p>It would have been easier to dismiss them as fools, but that wasn’t quite right. These women weren’t all stupid. They had simply chosen their safety over their dignity, their fathers over their sisters. They had decided it was better to be protected than to be powerful.</p><p>And then there was Pat Nixon. The perfect woman. The kind of woman that mothers raised their daughters to be. She was everything I was supposed to want. Silent, supportive, endlessly patient. A woman who stood in the background while the men talked. A woman who smiled through indignities so old and deep she had stopped recognizing them as wounds.</p><p>The Nixonettes were as much a product of 1950s suburbia as the man they idolized—a man who had learned long ago how to work their fears, how to sell them the illusion of strength while embodying only its shadow. Nixon was the ultimate patriarch, not because he was powerful, but because he was weak, insecure, desperate for validation. A man who had been rejected by his betters so often that he needed to dominate his lessers to feel whole.</p><p>And now the country had given itself to him, handed over its future to the same small and frightened men who had always been there, waiting for their chance to punish the world for making them feel small.</p><p>The cheers of the Nixonettes rang in my ears as I left the rally, past the girls with their fresh-pressed sashes, past the secretaries who would spend their lives in typing pools, past the housewives who were already congratulating themselves on having voted the right way. I wondered if, years from now, any of them would look back at this moment and wonder what they had done.</p><p class=\"ending-quote\">But I knew better. I knew they would look back with pride.</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<h3 class=\"tv-title\">Purple Heart</h3><p>Everything felt slow in the jungle, the low rolling fog, the hum of insects, the distant crack of gunfire—all blended into a steady, low murmur that bounced around a helmet before embedding in your skull. We were moving upriver, another routine patrol, but my mind was somewhere else.</p><p>John’s mind kept thinking back to November. About Ribicoff. About what it meant now that Nixon had won. Before forcing one’s mind back into the present, to attune your ears to this place and to stay sane. Because at any moment all hell could kick off.</p><p>“Keep your eyes open,” someone muttered and John’s hands gripped the wheel of the swift boat tighter. I had been at this long enough to know when something didn’t feel right, and the Mekong was too quiet.</p><p>I turned my head to say something to Delancey—our gunner—when the hell kicked off.</p><p>A rocket shot out from the trees, missing us by inches. The water churned as automatic fire rained down. We returned fire, the roar of the .50 cals ripping through the chaos. I dropped low, my heart jackhammering in my chest.</p><p>“Move, move, move!” someone shouted. The boat lurched forward as the boat’s engines were pushed to their limits. All the marines’ heads snapped back as a second explosion sent a shockwave through the hull.</p><p>Then the shrapnel hit him.</p><p>A five-inch piece of shrapnel, probably longer but John wasn’t able to recognize its full length. A chasm of pain channelled through his veins, lungs lunged for air which wouldn’t come, limbs fell limp. Eyes blurred and John’s legs fell out from under him. And then, nothing.</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<h3 class=\"tv-title\">Bring Us Together</h3><p><em>Ron Ziegler adjusted his tie and cleared his throat.</em> The press room was already filling up, as the nation’s media anticipated the newest revelation of Nixon’s cabinet. Today’s briefing had an added edge—the transition team had debated this one down to the bone, and now it was Ron’s job to let the cat out of the bag.</p><p>He ran through the prepared remarks in his head. The key terms he needed to hit: <strong>‘symbol of unity’</strong>, following through on the President-elect’s plan to <em>“Bring Us Together.”</em> That was the official line. But inside the transition, the decision had been anything but smooth.</p><p>One by one, the voices of dissent had lined up against it. John Mitchell had been against it from the start, muttering about “party loyalty” and questioning whether the man could really be trusted. Ehrlichman had wavered, weighing the risks against the potential benefits. Haldeman, as always, had watched without revealing his hand, waiting to see which way the wind blew.</p><p>But the boss made the call himself. He had picked up the phone, dialled Austin, and offered the job personally.</p><p>Ziegler tapped his fingers on the podium. The press would have questions, and they wouldn’t be gentle. He took a sip of water and looked at the waiting press corps. They didn’t see the manoeuvring, the backroom debates, the bruised egos—they only got to see the sausage after it was made.</p><p><strong>“Good afternoon. Today, I am pleased to announce that President-elect Nixon has selected Governor John Connally to serve as the next Ambassador to the United Nations...”</strong></p><p>Eyes widened and a sea of hands shot up.</p></div></div>",

With a blinding smile, armed with a fine-tuned folksy vernacular (modified on command), the freshman Senator and community organizer didn't spend his early years under the careful mentorship of Bill Ayers, Louis Farrakhan and Jeremiah Wright for nothing. He's a man on a mission from a lower power.<br><br>He's sacrificed much to be where he is today, having had to endure the muck of middle America, having to allow racist jackals like Hillary Clinton infiltrate his Cabinet to appease the blob. Yet if all goes according to plan, it'll have been worth it. Be it by hook or by crook, Obama will strive to tear down this country and rebuild, brick-by-brick. But if that course may alter, his arrogance will refuse defeat, even if it means a little ''compromise'' here and there. So long as he wins in the end, it'll have been for the greater good.</p>",

As far as political satire goes, the episode leaves much to be desired. Christie is portrayed as a ravenously hungry, cartoonishly sadistic bully. There's no real insight offered into his pro-Wall Street policies and how they've affected the country since he took office fourteen long months ago…</p><p>First, the episode's title appears to be a reference to the movie, “The Manchurian Candidate,” with the word “fat” forced in as a weak attempt at a movie reference. It doesn’t really work, especially since there is nothing else in the episode referencing the movie, but I always enjoy it when Family Guy episode titles are allusions to pop culture.</p><p>The episode starts with Peter relishing in Christie's election, since, as Peter puts it, “fat people are moving up in society” (liberal Brian, of course, is particularly upset by the election results, even though he can't help but bark at Obama every time he’s on TV). Peter decides he's entitled to more deference and respect from everyone given fat people's new exalted status. In one of the better scenes of the episode, he takes a baby out of a toddler swing seat at a park, crams himself in the swing seat, and demands the mom push him because “fat people rule the world now.” The seat painfully stretches as Peter stuffs his large body into it, and Peter can barely hide is physical discomfort beneath his self-satisfaction. It's cartoonishly absurd and really hits the mark. Unfortunately, the gags are mostly misses from there.</p><p>Lois and Peter visit the Pewterschmidts, and Peter begins ordering his in-laws' maids around. Peter's behavior in this scene is too childish and cruel to be funny. For example, he orders one maid to bathe him with a sponge under his fat folds, and missing child Madeleine McCann falls out. Not only is this unfunny given the tragedy of McCann's disappearance, but the writers seem to have recycled a prior gag where Stewie falls out of Peter's fat in 'He's Too Sexy for His Fat' (airdate June 27, 2000).</p><p>Carter catches wind that Peter is ordering his maids around and asks Peter what's gotten into him. After Peter (once again) explains that fat people rule the world now that Christie is president, Carter offers to introduce Peter to our nation's obese leader at a fundraiser. Delighted, Peter accepts Carter's invitation. The fundraiser sets up the contrast between Peter and the Griffin family's middle class values and those of the rich who back Christie and his Republican allies. As introduced by Carter Pewterschmidt, the attendees include fictional Wall Street villains of the Great Recession, including “Sub-Prime Mortgage CEO Duke Moneybags” and “Credit Rating Inflator Extraordinaire Max Cash-Steele.” Did the writers think these names would ever get a chuckle out of any viewers? To me, it seems they were under pressure to churn out an episode about Christie, the GOP, and Wall Street's overwhelming support for Christie, but didn’t have their hearts in it and lacked ideas. I did laugh, however, when after introducing Peter to some the attendees, Carter tells Peter that there are “plenty of other fat cats around” and the next shot zooms out to show literal fat cats all over the lavish display of food at the fundraiser.</p><p>Christie arrives at the fundraiser and begins choking after he attempts to eat an entire pig roast in one bite. The episode is full of cheap shots at Christie's weight, which I think distract from the commentary (as shallow as it is) about Christie's pro-Wall Street policies. The show has nothing to say, for example, about Christie's signature “Troubled Asset Stabilization Program,” which was just a belated giveaway of $500 billion to banks. Peter rushes in to perform the Heimlich maneuver, which Peter announces that he learned in a prior career as an EMT (there is a gross-out cutaway gag where as an EMT, Peter performs the Heimlich maneuver on a victim and then saves the forced-out food — chewed up lobster — for dinner). After Peter saves him, President Christie offers Peter a job in the Secret Service as his personal body guard.</p><p>Peter announces to the Griffin family that they're moving to Washington, D.C. for his work as Christie’s body guard. Lois is excited “to become one of those alcoholic, pill-popping D.C. socialites.” I’m not really sure what that was a reference to other than the writers' perception (or the writers' perception of their audiences' perception) that women in D.C. are dependent on alcohol and prescription medication. Peter tells Chris and Meg that he's “sure they'll turn out perfectly fine growing up in D.C. just like all the Republican presidents' kids,” which sets up a cut to a montage of Republican presidents' troubled children (including Reagan daughter Patti Davis, George W. Bush, and his twin daughters). Again, these strike me as below the belt shots at Republicans rather than real, cutting commentary about their policies.</p><p>Brian refuses to move because he can't stand the idea of supporting President Christie in any way. Stewie refuses to move to D.C. without Brian, and surreptitiously stays behind in Quahog (how the Griffins don't notice that their infant is missing is never explained). This begins a side plot about the two getting into trouble while home alone without Peter and Lois. The side plot is clearly based on the film “Risky Business” — the two get in trouble when they hire a call-girl, make a mess of the house, and struggle to put everything back together. I've written this many times before, but this show can't seem to decide whether it is trying to appeal to adults in their forties familiar with 80s pop culture references or adolescent boys. But honestly this side plot is the best part of the episode.</p><p>In D.C., Peter spends enormous amounts of time following Christie around, and the two become buddies. At first, they mostly watch sports and eat fast food together, but Christie reveals himself to be too cruel for Peter to accept.  The turning point in their relationship is when Christie invites Peter to watch a family be evicted from their home by a mortgage company. There is another mean spirited, not-so-funny gag where Christie adds that thinking about foreclosure evictions is the “only way” he can “climax” with his wife, and a fictionalized version of First Lady Mary Pat with very exaggerated, unflattering features enters the scene. Anyway, Peter, whose sense of empathy throughout the show is terribly uneven, feels for the evicted family and begins to question his decision to work as Christie's bodyguard.</p><p>Peter's break with Christie comes when Christie reveals that he is going to replace the country's drinking water with Mountain Dew so everyone can be fat, which would bar anyone from teasing Christie over his weight (and so Christie can get a campaign donation from the owners of Mountain Dew). Peter imagines Lois, Chris, and Stewie drinking gallons of Mountain Dew, becoming morbidly obese, and struggling to breathe (one of the show's funnier gags is when, as part of this sequence, Peter imagines Meg as morbidly obese as part of this sequence and breaking the fourth wall, declares, “I don’t care about her.”). Peter can't bring himself to let Christie follow through on his plan. Peter stops the plan by revealing it to the public delivering a decent speech editorializing about selfishness and greed in politics.</p><p>The Griffins move back to Quahog. Meanwhile, Brian and Stewie (almost) get the house back in order just in time for Peter, Lois, Chris, and Meg to get home. The episode ends with a some classic Family Guy dark humor: a dead call-girl falling out of the ceiling onto Meg, seriously injuring her, only for the family to ignore her pain so they can unpack.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed this review.

Evidence of the health problems persisted amid his speeches where the president was found to exhibit several alarming symptoms, including: dysarthria, tremors, and – according to White House personnel – severe headaches that'd prevent the president from working for upwards of 2 hours a day.</p><p>Herman Cain, as vice president, ascended to the office and was subsequently endorsed by Paul, who departed Washington back to his native Texas.</p><p>The claim is the leave was involuntary on Paul's part, and Cain and the Republican Party orchestrated a 'coup' that forced Paul's hand into stepping down. This conspiracy has found a popular base of support from users on Reddit and 4chan, who have both frequently made the claim, with the latter often posting it alongside racist 'memes' of the incumbent president, all of which regularly invoke the belief Cain had a part in Paul's undoing. Even Paul himself has gone on record to suggest as much in the time since he's left office, saying in a recent interview with infamous conspiracy theorist Alex Jones: “I was thrown out. Herman did me in, really.”</p><p><b><big>The Facts About Paul's Resignation</big></b></p><p>President Paul's term prior to the leave saw him already on ill terms with his party's establishment. His decision to aide in Senator Ted Cruz's efforts to lead a government shutdown in the fall of 2013 saw it stretch into the new year, before his orders were disobeyed and a select handful of Republicans agreed to cooperate with Democrats to reopen it again. This plummeted the president's popularity to a low of 23%, and among Republicans he stood at a fairly poor 67%. Among presidents, their personal approval within their party averages above 70% at a base minimum, with the lowest in recent record being President George W. Bush polling at 57% with Republicans in October 2008, according to Gallup.</p><p>However, that being said, there was never any indication Paul was being forced into leaving, especially by Vice President Herman Cain. In Paul's own words since departing, Cain “was one of the only men there I could trust.” That is not to say there existed no animosity, though, as reports emerged that during debates over drafting tax reform, the two got into it when deliberating tax rates. Paul, according to <i>The New York Times</i>, demanded a total reversal from his 2012 pledge to institute a 0–2–2 proposal, which was seen as a compromise between the two candidates. When Cain heard of this, he allegedly “called the president a 'hick fool.'”</p><p>Regardless, other than disagreements over taxes, the two never seemed particularly antagonistic towards one another otherwise. Where there did exist heated resentment was between Paul and several moderate Republicans in the House and Senate, most prominently Senators John McCain, Lisa Murkowski, Thad Cochran and Speaker John Boehner. Talks frequently collapsed as Paul refused to compromise or back away from his campaign platform; he would go so far as to veto a 30-million dollar aide package meant for the CDC to combat the ebola outbreak in September 2014 after the president unsuccessfully tried to crowbar in an amendment, introduced by Senator Mike Lee of Utah, that would've established a 'public citizen review panel' for grant applications and cut funding for several CDC programs that totaled to 20% of the federal agency's yearly budget.</p><p>It was at this point even Paul was aware of his inability to work with Congress and keep government compatible with his libertarian viewpoints:</p><p><blockquote>“The president was reported as having turned to his son, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, before saying, 'we're on borrowed time. I don't see any of this working out.'” – '<u>Inside the Calamity of the Paul Administration</u>' - <i>The New York Times</i>, April 3, 2014</blockquote></p><p>As such, opinion pieces and public statements from conservative and Republican Party figures began to emerge suggesting Paul had to step down for the longterm health of the country and party, as division regularly defined the Paul White House. An impeachment vote was even suggested, albeit in what was at the time described to be a 'joking' manner, by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who further said he “could easily get the vote to rally to a two-thirds majority if needed.”</p><p>Following a bloodbath result where Democrats managed to capture back the Senate and only narrowly failed to clinch the House of Representatives purely due to large-scale, systematic gerrymandering in favor of Republicans, the calls started to really intensify, with Democratic members of Congress also flirting with the possibility. None of this involved Cain's doing, who hadn't voiced displeasure with Paul or his administration, at least publicly.</p><p>The one component that is frequently cited by those in the camp that Cain may have had a hand in Paul's demise is an article by the <i>New York Post</i> in late March 2015, that, quoting an anonymous source from inside the vice president's staff, said “if we needed to, the 25th is the way to go, but we don't think it'll need to come to that.” Cain's office denied the comment came from them and rejected the story, and other media outlets failed to carry it in the aftermath. The <i>New York Post</i> stood by their story, however.</p><p>Due to conflicting claims and a lack of concrete evidence to support the 'coup' charge, we have no choice but to rule it unproven until something much more substantial may come out in the future that can either definitively prove or disprove it outright.</p><p><b><center>Sources</center></b></p><p><center>▼</center></p><p>By Liz Howe</p><p>Elizabeth Howe is a journalist from the Bakersfield area who started her career as a daily newspaper reporter and has covered everything from crime to local government to national politics.

The American embassy has released a statement claiming the president “wasn't given the proper context” beforehand about the notorious hate group he was speaking to. In his speech, Arpaio made much work whinging over his failed domestic bid to construct a moat across the border between the U.S. and Mexico, which had been denied funding by the American legislature.</p><p>The domestic and international condemnation was swift and furious. Prince Charles was reported as having “flown into a ballistic rage” when he received word of the president's visit just an hour after having shook his hand, whereas Prince Harry went so far as to try and coax journalists present to delete photographs taken of him standing with Mr. Arpaio.</p><p>Arpaio continued to deny knowledge of the group's extremist and racist belief system to media outlets, Press Secretary Sean Spicer reiterated the denial to reporters later earlier today and stated someone would be sacked for the cock-up. The BBC reports that the president, at one point, made mention that he had “the reputation of being the biggest racist in the United States,” to which the EDL members in attendance clapped and cheered in response. A confused Arpaio would question afterward, “what are you clapping for? That I am or that I'm not? Well, I'm not.” He proceeded to exit the stage and take photos with Tommy Robinson, the hate group's founder and leader who decided to continue his work with them in 2013, even suggesting in a speech during Arpaio's visit that seeing him defeat former U.S. President Barack Obama was “encouraging” and was a catalyst that persuaded him to continue his efforts.</p><p><br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/91louBb.png><br></p><p>Arpaio was to meet with Prime Minister Nick Clegg, and even tried to after meeting with Robinson, but the entire affair was subsequently cancelled, with U.S. officials even outright ejected from 10 Downing Street once the news hit. Mass protests in the heart of London over Arpaio's visit had already been transpiring, but grew much more intense once the Robinson meeting became widely circulated news. The U.S. Congress, led by members of the Democratic Party, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, did issue a follow-up statement apologising for the misconduct of their president: “We hold nothing but anger at the president's decision to give credence to extremists and racists, and call on him to apologise justly.” Arpaio said he “had no clue who [he] was speaking to” and suggested because of that he “wasn't entitled to apologise.”</p><p>The issue is becoming a minor controversy abroad, adding another row to the beleaguered campaign of Arpaio's vice president, Bobby Jindal.</p><p>Jindal, unlike his boss, would apologise, saying the administration “abhors hate and neo-Nazism.” Similar sentiments were expressed by White House officials, including infamous archconservative Pat Buchanan and previously recalled politician Russell Pearce, who both denied knowledge of Robinson's reputation.</p><p>Worst news couldn't be less welcome for the president, as Mr. Arpaio is hot off a recent impeachment vote, with a vote in the lower legislative body of the U.S. House clearing the bar easily on charges of high crimes and misdemeanors, but which fell well short of such a vote succeeding in the chamber's upper house, the U.S. Senate. The Cabinet of the president has rejected calls to issue the 25th amendment, too, which would remove Arpaio from the post of president, replacing him with Mr. Jindal. U.S. Vice President Bobby Jindal affirmed he “stands by the president” when questioned by reporters, though stressed he was “[his] own man.”</p><p>Arpaio announced in early 2014 he would not seek reelection, claiming to have accomplished all he set out to do when he first ran in 2012. Jindal is due to face U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of the state of Vermont in the American presidential election this upcoming November. Jindal has avoided fully embracing his endorsement from Arpaio, who at present moment holds a 23% approval rating, a slight increase from this time last year.</p>",

This time, he's not playing nice.<h3>Doctor Who – “The Vanguards of Varos” Review | <i>The A.V. Club</i> | Review</h3>\n              <p><big><center><b>THE DOCTOR RETURNS TO FACE AN OLD FOE. BUT DOES THIS FIT THE VIBE OF THE TIMES?</b></center></big></p><p>This week’s episode of <i>Doctor Who</i> sees a callback to an earlier, more iffy period of the show’s history. A sequel to the Colin Baker era episode “Vengeance on Varos,” a sendup on the Thatcherite and Moral Majority politics of its time, “The Vanguards of Varos” wishes to carry over some of that charged commentary that episode brought to the table to the modern day in order to commentate on similar practices we see in the year 2017. But does it work? <i>Well</i>…</p><p>The Doctor (Idris Elba), and his companions, Marty (Chris O’Dowd) and Scarlett (Emily Ratajkowski), return to the planet of Varos, where the Governor (with Martin Jarvis returning) is presiding over a failing state. The Governor has fully turned a new leaf from his previous role early in the last serial, now embracing the late-stage characterization and going further to push reforms. But trouble persists, as such reforms are met with harsh resistance that crescendo on the ill-prepared statesman, who through a combination of compromise, backroom cowardice, and full-on endgame desperation, ultimately fails in his promised goals. Sil (voiced by returning Nabil Shaban), the antagonist of the original serial, has again found himself back on Varos, taking advantage of the incompetence to reclaim power once more, this time propelled by the support of the people who’ve forgotten of his villainy due to being blinded by their hate of the current management.</p><p>One component, but a major one, that unfortunately lets this episode down is its needless cynicism. Now, I hate getting so overtly political, but this episode is inviting it, and my problems with it are mainly related to that. So that in mind, if you’re not ready for a trauma dump on the last 16 years of the American political dumpster fire, you’re advised to click away.</p><p>The way it portrays the world of Varos following the downfall of its former tyrannical overlord and lampoons the directionless and inept idealism of the Governor is poorly conveyed. What it is <i>attempting</i> to do is fairly obvious: its a commentary on the political situation in the United States. But where it goes with this is misplaced, almost lacking proper foresight.</p><p>The Obama presidency was one built on hope, moving past the bleak Bush II tenure; no, it didn’t succeed, sure, but the vibes, if you’d like to refer to them as such, were still fairly positive. So why is this episode so negative in the Obama stand-ins’ government? Only due to the handicaps dealt to Obama, like the banks going bust, can you really fault him. All his downsides were due to external circumstances. If the banks didn’t go bust under him nobody would be making excuses, with a 60-seat Senate, who in their right mind would? So to characterize the starry-eyed reformers so meanly and critically screams of edgy pessimism.</p><p>We should give these reformers of ours a lot more breaks and excuses, if only to combat the natural resistance they receive from the opposition. Which brings me to the allegory of the Governor’s (a.k.a. Obama) failure leading the way back to Sil (a.k.a. President John McCain) to return to power. This goes back to my prior point. Nobody would be saying this had Obama not been cut at the knees, and yes, that’s hypothetical, but you can’t so boldly portray this doomerist narrative without first conceding had things only gone a bit differently, we’d be in a very different world.</p><p>Had Obama, say, served out his two terms, not plagued at every turn by critics, not dragging the weight of the recession with him, whose to say this wouldn’t have lead to a more progressive United States? How likely would it have truly been, if you’d indulge me, dear reader, that a two-term Obama presidency wouldn’t have effectively killed the Republican Party? I find it highly likely myself, acknowledging the changing demographics of the country, the new up-and-coming generation certainly the most left-wing we’ve ever seen, and with a successful Democratic president to look up to, I think we were this close to a truly great world.</p><p>So with “The Vanguards of Varos,” I’m just left rolling my eyes. Only the imbecilic centrists and those resistant to truly embrace the changemakers would accept this overly-cynical message. Maybe had the episode chose to satirize those who were more obviously evil, like if they were some kind of slimy caricature of a more unlikable politician, like last year’s failed contender Hillary Clinton, or even put more emphasis on Sil (again, obviously meant to be a vague representation of John McCain/the right-wing) as the driver of bad things happening, I might see where this episode was coming from. But someone who was promising hope and change like Obama? I don’t buy it. This episode just misses the mark.</p><p><b>3.9/10</b>.</p>",

Yiannopoulos, born and raised in the town of Chatham in England, had been residing in the United States on an O-1 visa and reportedly fostered a friendship with the president following a meeting orchestrated by staffers in her administration. <span style=\"color:lightblue;\"><u>According to sources</u></span>, the adoption had been pitched by Bachmann when Yiannopoulos began speaking of his complicated parental situation and, as Reuters reports it, “offhandedly mentioned he was a homosexual.” Bachmann, reportedly, gasped and began caressing his cheek, saying, “you poor thing.”</p><p>Following the authentication of the adoption following months of legal issues being settled, it had further been confirmed, this time by <i>The New York Times</i>, that the president had planned a private 'baptismal ceremony' for Yiannopoulos. Bachmann denied allegation she was partaking in the practice of gay conversion therapy with her newly adopted son, instead insisting it had been Yiannopoulos's idea.</p><p>Yiannopoulos addressed reporters, saying he's “engaged in acts that had been taught to me by authoritative figures in my life” when he was younger, who he further claimed consisted of “radical Social Justice Warriors and feminists.” The baptism held for Yiannopoulos sparked intense discussion over the message the president was sending, with several Democratic politicians claiming it to have been blurring the lines between the separation of church and state, with others more bluntly called Bachmann a “bigot” for orchestrating the event at all.</p><p>Bachmann denied such allegations, instead releasing a statement through the press secretary that she “was partaking in a private affair” that didn't relate to her government duties. The baptism was not filmed, however it was captured by White House photographers who have yet to make them public. The photos have been requested for public release under FOIA laws by several media organizations following the event, which Bachmann claims would “make the situation one made public by the mainstream media” and free her of any claims that suggest otherwise. Though, she reiterated her belief that the premise of separation of church and state was “a myth propagated by those who wish to eliminate Christian voices from our government” (this is not true, the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment does indeed outline a separation of church and state when it comes to what laws may be enacted by Congress).</p><p>The president also intends to have her new son join her in speaking to CPAC, a gathering of prominent conservative voices and politicians that meet on a yearly basis. Yiannopoulos will speak to the attendees and, according to sources familiar, make his and his mother's opposition to same-sex marriage a core focus, with Bachmann hoping to lead a repeal of <i>Obergefell v. Hodges</i> sometime in her second term. How she intends to do so is currently unknown.</p><p><span style=\"color:lightblue;\"><u>Sources suggest she will showcase her policy successes that were achieved during her first term</u></span>, most prominently her push for the mandatory chemical castration of registered sex offenders. The law has overridden state restrictions on the practice for those that may have previously forbid or didn't have any prior law regarding it on their books. Controversy persists as the ACLU continues its lawsuit over the legislation, with representatives for the legal nonprofit arguing it violates the Eighth Amendment regarding “cruel and unusual punishment.” Though her rivals in the Democratic primary have thus far all failed to state their position on the issue, Bachmann has repeatedly mentioned it, and those close to the administration say it'll be a key component of her reelection platform.</p><p>The tactic is speculated to be of a similar manner to that of the Republican strategy employed during the 2014 midterms, where the party, in light of their shock success in unseating incumbent President Barack Obama two years previously, felt “emboldened” to take on much stronger positions on social issues. Though it varied in success (of particular memorability was the South Dakota Senate election where Republican nominee Kristi Noem <span style=\"color:lightblue;\"><u>accused her opponent, incumbent Democratic Senator Tim Johnson, of being a “groomer” for not opposing gender affirmation care</u></span>; she managed to scrape by with a 2-point win), it didn't see the drastic losses some pundits had anticipated heading into it. Instead, the Republicans picked up multiple Senate seats, mainly those of states that typically vote red at the federal level, including Arkansas and Louisiana.</p><p>Following her attendance at CPAC, the president will travel abroad to Israel, where she plans to meet one-on-one with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and discuss issues regarding the growing threat of Islamic extremist groups present within the region.</p><p>Read more:</p><p><center>- <span style=\"color:lightblue;\"><u>Imprisoned Pvt.

It's a little bit hard to understand you, maybe the reception is coming in bad. But, look, Obama. I want a complete and total shakedown. This needs to end in a deportation. A deportation, Rudy. I want Obama deported. I want you to find me the evidence.</p><p>GIULIANI: Mr. President, I've had the DOJ look through it, I'm not finding anything on it. I can't promise anything on that right now, at least not yet, unless we find something, we can. I'm looking through it all I just don't see it, Donald. I'm going to direct them again and if we can't find anything we might have to drop it altogether.</p><p>TRUMP: Rudy, I'm saying to you, find me the evidence. Find me the real birth certificate. I want to, I want a discovery. I want you to go and discover something. Get me a discovery and I can look into it myself, Rudy, okay?</blockquote></p><p>Two weeks ago, the tape was released to the general public, leading to the House of Representatives to adopt impeachment articles against President Trump. Trump's approval rating has now reached an all-time low, standing at only 34% as of <span style=\"color:lightblue;\"><u>Gallup's recent estimations</u></span>. The White House continues to vehemently deny the existence of the tape, with the president himself having called it “fake news” and “doctored” at his most recent press conference yesterday.</p><p>When reached for comment, Obama declined to make a statement, however, former vice president Joe Biden condemned Trump's actions as bigoted, and encouraged the Senate to remove him from office.</p><p>This comes amid a series of recent struggles for Trump, given his reelection bid, in which he is lagging behind presumptive nominee Martin O'Malley. <span style=\"color:lightblue;\"><u>A new Emerson College poll</u></span> showed him behind by nearly 10 points following the impeachment. Despite entering office with an approval rating of 59%, his popularity quickly declined after the economy failed to properly recover, along with his refusal to give more established voices in the Republican Party a say in his administration. Amid a primary challenge from Governor John Kasich of Ohio, Trump has frequently reshuffled his cabinet with much more conservative members in an effort to block out Kasich's appeal. Despite this, however, Kasich has won a sizable portion of delegates, even winning some contests outright such as in the state of Vermont.</p><p>The president is also being investigated for allegations of paying hush money to porn actress Stormy Daniels in 2011, hoping to prevent his campaign from being harmed had it come out during the election. That story was also recently leaked through a tape with Trump and Michael Cohen, in which the president mentioned having done so through a non-disclosure agreement.</p><p>The Senate trial is set to be held next week, where, according to multiple anonymous staffers, Trump has a very real chance of being removed from office following confirmation by Arizona's John McCain that he'll vote in favor of it.</p><p>This remains a developing story.</p>",

Unfortunately for the scandal-plagued incumbent, that would not be the case. Three minutes into his eulogy for the late head of state, a woman in business attire would be seen marching through the audience. Security briefly blocked her from proceeding, until she flashed what appeared to be a form of identification, and was given permission to continue.</p><p>Heading to the main stage where Petraeus was speaking, she interrupted his speech and said something inaudible, not captured by the president's microphone but what was reported by onlookers and those nearby as having been: “President Petraeus, you've been served.”</p><p>Petraeus bent down to retrieve the folder from the individual, visibly confused over the commotion and ability of the person to have been able to bypass Secret Service. Giving the contents a glance, the president's face grew angry as his eyebrows raised and a frown emerged, which he quickly covered up with a cough as he pocketed the contents of the folder into his suit jacket and continued with the eulogy.</p><p>It would later be revealed by sources that the folder contained Petraeus's divorce papers, and he had just been served in a public setting. His former, now estranged wife, Holly, denied request for comment by reporters. The White House has similarly refused to acknowledge the incident, now gathering millions of views on the internet through circulated clips on YouTube, with Press Secretary Sheri Annis declining to answer several questions regarding it. Vice President John Kasich did, however, let it slip during a recent visit to Niagara Falls in New York yesterday evening that “those things aren't just random, they're planned. I'd like to hope that wasn't the case.” Kasich didn't elaborate further.</p><p>Congressional Republicans are furious, with Utah Senator Orrin Hatch promising to subpoena Secret Service director Julia Pierson and hearings to be held over what they're calling a “breach of security and betrayal of public trust.” Congressional Democrats have remained tight-lipped, though a staffer for Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland would be privately admonished for tweeting about the incident accompanied by a laughing emoji, according to reporting by the <i>New York Post</i>.</p><p>The president has been embroiled in controversy since the Obama DOJ had leaked the information behind his affair with military intelligence officer Julia Broadwell last year. Despite the hit to his personal favorability, the Republican managed to reverse course and stage a stunning comeback, where he unseated Obama the November of that same year. However, drama over Petraeus's marriage status has remained, with Holly Petraeus confirming her intention to split from the president shortly after he was inaugurated earlier this year. Criminal proceedings over Petraeus having allegedly shared classified information with Broadwell has also been ongoing, though isn't expected to result in a felony conviction of the president.</p><p><br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/hTKoGPh.png><br></p>",

Attending in recognition of a recent breakthrough in aerodynamics discovered by student Maulik Patel, who was receiving a 5,000 dollar grant as part of the administration's Interstellar Innovation Program, Santorum was supposed to simply hand the medallion and ceremonial giant check to Patel. Instead, Santorum cracked the medal in half, revealing it to be made of chocolate, before taking to the microphone. “I'm sick of this charade,” he said, “I didn't become a Republican Party politician so I could be the spokesman for NASA. I've counted, there've been 140,962 women that've been forced into back alley, coat-hanger abortions since me and the president have taken office due to our administration shutting down access to abortion, who we may also confirm have been rendered completely infertile due to complications that resulted from such procedures. That's simply not enough.”</p><p>President Newt Gingrich addressed the critiques made by his number two hours later after being asked for comment by reporters. “In the instance where the party platform conflicts with my ability to self-aggrandize and indulge in my own legend, I frankly don't give a shit.” Gingrich has, according to <i>The Onion</i> Geppetto index, changed his position on the legality of abortion five-hundred and ninety-two times in just the last six weeks alone. Gingrich has maintained a comparatively consistent message on positions pertaining to other issues, such as a ban on all bidets in the United States for being “too European” and barring State Secretary John Bolton from appearing on television anymore. The partnership between him and Santorum has worsened over time, however. He previously suggested he'd swap out Santorum with everyone ranging from actress Sarah Silverman to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. “I'll take anyone willing to remain in my shadow,” Gingrich said. “I just don't trust monogamists. If you can't multitask in your personal life I can't expect you to be able to do the same in the workplace.”</p><p>Santorum has said his plans for the future remain up in the air. He said he may pose a primary challenge to the president in 2016 or alternatively found a cultist community in the far backwoods of Idaho that'll hunt down and kill horny teenagers that may be camping and engaging in premarital copulation in similar fashion to villains of low-budget slasher flicks. “I don't like to tie myself down, I'm keeping my options open.”</p><p><br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Y0Rhrbb.png><br></p><p>- <u>Former President Obama Volunteers Himself to Coal Country Democrats For Ritualistic Flogging In Campaign Ads</u></p><p>- <u>Republicans Upset Republican President Is Passing Republican Policies That Remind People They Hate Republicans</u></p><p>- <u>Tom Harkin Requesting Secret Service Protection After Waking Up To Find Pig Testicles Left By Joni Ernst In His Bed</u></p>",

If your administration makes an enemy out of big business, Romney will certainly be the one to face you in November.<h3>President to address nation in aftermath of Midtown Manhattan Norton-Hyatt supermarket fire | CNBC | Politics</h3>\n              <p>Published Jul 12, 2013</p><p>By Howard Bates; Yussef Faasil<br><br><span style=\"color:darkblue;\">KEY POINTS</span></p><p>• <u>Fire in New York City has created headaches for administration in wake of single-day sales tax decrease</u></p><p>• <u>Owners of supermarket victim to fire under active investigation by authorities</u></p><p>• <u>Mitt Romney addresses nation in aftermath of fiery incident</u></p><p>The controversial 'National Day of Mega Sales' as heavily pushed by the Romney White House and Republican House experienced the worst publicity possible early yesterday, after a supermarket located in Midtown Manhattan, Norton-Hyatt, fell victim to a raging fire. Early estimates are already pinning it as the worst non-wildfire in American history. The death toll is floating above the 300 mark, according to sources with knowledge of processes involving the search for survivors and victims' remains in the aftermath of such incidents.</p><p>Reportedly, a grease fire was sparked in a fast food outlet located in the food court area of the supermarket's shopping center. Discovered roughly two minutes after it initially started, orders to evacuate came out immediately. However, there existed limited space to safely and orderly leave the market from, with only two, one located in the front and another specifically marked as a fire exit placed near the rear of the mall, being made available.</p><p>It is being alleged that supermarket owners, father and son duo Isaiah and Wyatt Williams, had told store management to keep the doors closed via the store's electronic security system after being informed of the evacuation, fearing thievery of goods. After around four minutes of delay, the security personnel abandoned their posts and the doors were once again opened. The Williams have denied such, and affirmed the security system had experienced a system failure as a result of the fire, as well as a miscommunication between them and their store management having had occurred, allowing for a stall in the evacuation process.</p><p>Promoted in the wake of President Romney's failed effort to push tax reform through the divided houses of Congress, the single-day event was cooked up by administration officials and economic experts from several fiscally conservative think tanks in a legally dubious move. Romney held doubts, <span style=\"color:lightblue;\"><u>but according to reporting by <i>Politico</i></span></u>, he was convinced by Treasury Secretary Mike Leavitt, who lobbied hard on behalf of it, plus a legal counsel meeting with law experts from the Heritage Foundation suggesting the measure was in the grey area, and wouldn't necessarily constitute an abuse of presidential powers. Signing an executive order to get the ball rolling, Romney made it conditional for states to receive funding for infrastructure loans, a package passed by the split Congress, to lower their sales tax, if they had one, to an average of 0% for a day. As Romney rationalized, “the temporary tax alteration will help serve to demonstrate the positives of a newer system to the individual governments of tax-burdened states.” He further suggested it would help accrue data for later pilot programs, and benefits would be experienced overtime for just the one-time decrease alone in consumer activity.</p><p>CNN's Jim Acosta “went there,” according to outlets, asking Romney if his administration's push to promote a single-day, national 'mega sale' to build public sentiment in favor of a sales tax reduction might've served as a catalyst for the fire, further calling it a “gimmick” in his inquiry to the president. The line of questioning prompted an emotional response from Romney: “The assertion that our administration's incentives for a one-day sale to generate some economic rejuvenation might've caused this is repugnant,” Romney responded. “I'm going to — I'm — I'm requesting a retraction from your outlet on that. I take great offense to that, and I don't appreciate the assertion. You should be ashamed for having asked that question. CNN owes an apology to the families for using their loved ones' deaths as a political tool.”</p><p>The president has been experiencing several emotional outbursts as of late, <span style=\"color:lightblue;\"><u>as first reported by <i>The Washington Post</i></span></u> last month. Though keeping his public appearances of vulnerability mostly concealed, he has, if anonymous sources are to be believed, cried at every closed-door meeting since January.</p><p>“It's a tragedy all around,” Jim Weissman, the lawyer retained by the Williamses, told media outlets. “We're all dealing with the ramifications of it and the damage created. My clients are working closely with the FDNY and cooperating with investigators. No further comment at this time.”</p><p><span style=\"color:gold;\">MORE LIKE THIS STORY</span></p><p>• <u>U.S. credit rating downgraded ahead of shutdown talks</u></p><p>• <u>NASDAQ takes dip; Tesla, Take-Two up</u></p><p>• <u>Fed Chairman Glenn Hubbard to make announcement on interest rates</u></p>",

President Bush (it’s still difficult to realize we’ve got three of those now) is on the last leg of the campaign, currently in a close contest with Democrat Paul Wellstone of Minnesota (it’s a faux pas to say this, but again, I have to condemn the fact this campaign is nearly at an end and the Bush team have not once addressed the <u><span style=\"color:lightblue;\">credible accusations that Wellstone died in a plane crash in 2002 and was replaced with a clone</span></u>; yeah, I know there’s been the leaks saying they don’t want the dumb leftie conspiracies about 2000 being stolen stuff to get drudged up in retaliation, but seriously, how’d Wellstone survive that?). We’ve got an economy back on track thanks to Bush’s Tax Relief and Jobs Act, foreign relations stabilized since the absolute hellfire that was the Obama regime (highlight being when Bush threatened to obliterate North Korea during that Sony drama, forever proving the critics wrong when they said Jeb was a “wimp like his old man,” pathetic), and a qualified candidate on the Court in Justice Neil Gorsuch replacing the late great Antonin Scalia earlier this year.</p><p>So, why does it feel like a failure of a term?</p><p>I don’t want to sound like I’m condemning the president, obviously, he’s got my vote without much question against that nutty socialistic loon on the other side of the aisle, but we conservatives don’t skirt the truth; when something smells bad, we call it out, and I’ve got to be honest and say if a Bush second term is what we receive we need a serious overhaul if we want the Republican Party to ever have a president again whose name isn’t synonymous with hedge trimmers.</p><p>Case in point: rhetoric. No, I don’t subscribe to those dumb wimp remarks or the inane mockery that pilloried our president unfairly throughout his term, but it has to be said, he did himself no favors at many times.</p><p>Remember when he announced Soleimani died? When he killed him in that strike on Iran? That was a moment practically begging for a good victory lap or something that just screamed ‘We’re America. Terrorists Beware.’ What does Jeb do? He announces it at a press conference and, oh god, when he said “please clap” after he was done speaking. Epic fail. I still have to see those memes on the timeline when we could be discussing literally anything of substance.</p><p>What I’m saying is, we got a good Republican president, but what we need is a Republican president with some balls. Someone whose mean, who, frankly, bullies the bullies in the Democrat Party back when they hammer us for ridiculous nonsense like the tax cuts, or on gun control, or, and especially on this, the mental illness that was that bathroom bill backlash in North Carolina. Bush has repeatedly failed to upstage the critics, and for that, even with all the success he’s achieved, it could easily have proved pointless if by some act of supreme stupidity the American people send Senator Breadlines to the White House next month.</p><p>Everybody reading this, please vote. And for all the administration interns who might have stumbled across this, get Jeb to stop wearing those dumb glasses already, he looks like a fucking dweeb.</p>",

            "description": "<i>He's like Joe Arpaio, but Jewish. This may prove a bridge too far for his voters.</i><br><br>Alarmed by your administration's radical anti-police agenda, Mayor Bloomberg offers himself up as a bipartisan voice who'll bring stability back to America like he brought to New York.<h3>Inside the Bloomberg White House's Renovation of the East Room | <i>Architectural Digest</i> | Architecture + Design</h3>\n              <p><center><small>In a new book, Frederick Keating details the process behind the overhaul of the East Room into a layout of 5x5 cubicles</small></center></p><p><center>By Jock Little</center></p><p><center>Photography by Julia Kendrick</center></p><p><center><small>September 1, 2016</small></center></p><p>One of Michael Bloomberg's more audacious and peculiar proposals during his 2012 campaign for president revolved around the suggestion of transforming the East Room of the White House into what he described as an “office plan” where members of his Cabinet's staff would come together in an open and inclusive space. It's not always the president expresses plans to fundamentally transform the way 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue itself looks and operates beyond how First Ladies choose to decorate the building around the holidays. Jimmy Carter would attempt to bring in solar panels that would subsequently be removed by his successor, Ronald Reagan. In this instance, the successor of Bloomberg's, whether it may come this year or 2020, is going to find much more difficulty in doing away with the changes he's brought to their residence from before he arrived.</p><p>In a new book by <i>AD100</i> designer Frederick Keating, the refurbishment and redesign of the East Room into Bloomberg's vision is meticulously detailed. <i>All Business: The Extraordinary Story Behind the Bloomberg White House</i> (<u>Simon & Schuster</u>, <u>September 1</u>) is a complete and comprehensive guide behind the 15$ million undertaking to transform it into a bureaucrat's sanctuary. Open cubicles, workers diligently moving across the room from multiple desks at a time, and a president at the heart of it all seeking to hear from each and every employee about what they're thinking and working on at any given moment of time. It all traces back to Bloomberg's time at his eponymous Bloomberg LP, the financial data and information company the president founded all the way back in 1981.</p><p>“I'm transforming this place, fundamentally, into one of work and dedication,” says Bloomberg, quoted in the book, lifted from memos and other material he'd correspond with to Keating and others involved in the renovation process. “Digital correspondence is not going to help us, we need to increase the rate of face-to-face interactions. As president, I need to be there and overseeing just what my guys in the administration are doing. All the time. I know from experience back in New York that an open office plan is going to do exactly that.”</p><p>As such, the first thing to transpire was discarding the interior decorations of the East Room left from before he'd kickstart his plans. A few of the material would be donated to the Smithsonian Institution, though most of it would be aunctioned off to wealthy bidders, with proceeds returning back to the federal government. This included Giuseppe Cerachhi's marble bust of George Washington and the gilded grand piano donated by Steinway & Sons back in 1903. This created some controversy, but it was as Bloomberg had wanted it to go, valuing results over reverence of the past, as he described it.</p><p>An infamous complication arrived, following the official launch of the East Room office space in September of 2014, when intruder and Iraq War veteran Omar Gonzalez, suffering from PTSD, ran through the East Room and completely destroyed every piece of equipment present. A quarter of the budget that had been allocated to the project was gone in an instant, and it brought some major egg on the president's face as a result. That wouldn't be too big of an issue for long, however, as through some crafty and shrewd bartering, the equipment destroyed would be replaced by state of the art computer hardware from 1998, Apple iMac G3 desktop computers, installed with the latest version of Windows 98 from that year. “Was it a setback? Certainly,” Bloomberg commented in an interview with George Stephanopoulos for ABC the following month, “but there's never been an issue we as Americans cannot overcome.”</p>",

            "description": "<i>Never lost a war yet.</i><br><br>Bush's former Iraq military governor, General Stanley McChrystal fumes after your decision to terminate him. Rumor is he may seek revenge on you this November.<h3>Nate Silver Predicts a Close 2016 Presidential Race | ABC News | Politics</h3>\n              <p><br><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Fsgx8fm.png><br></p><p><small>Election forecaster Nate Silver provides his 2016 predictions.</small></p><p>By ABC News</p><p>November 6, 2016, 10:48 AM</p><p><small>FiveThirtyEight founder and editor-in-chief Nate Silver thinks both candidates still have their work cut out for them ahead of Election Day.</small></p><p>Election forecaster Nate Silver said on Sunday that Stanley McChrystal is the clear favorite to remain president but argued the race is closer than most analysts are anticipating.</p><p>“The electoral math is more solid for McChrystal than it was for [President Barack] Obama four years ago,” Silver said in an interview with George Stephanopoulos. “So that bodes well for the Democrats this go-around.”</p><p>Silver became a prominent election forecaster during the 2008 election, and his assessment of candidates' electoral chances have been closely followed ever since. This year his work has come under scrutiny because while his models show McChrystal the favorite in the race, he is less bullish on his chances than other forecasters.</p><p>“You'd rather be in the president's shoes than Rick Perry, but it's not an incredibly safe position,” Silver said.</p><p>The reason McChrystal's polling lead, though more sturdy than Obama's was four years ago, may be in doubt, is that the race is closer in some swing states, especially in the Midwest. That means that if he loses only one big state forecast for him, he loses the White House, Silver said.</p><p>The other issue is that McChrystal's base is difficult to determine, having switched parties from Republican to Democratic in early 2015, leading to a chaotic latter half of his term featuring the president going out of his way to repair burnt bridges. Following a nationwide apology tour with Barack Obama, the very man he beat for president in 2012, and other bigwigs involved with the Democratic Party, he's all but completely bled his support with Republicans, who've since fled en masse. When you have a situation as uncommon as that, Silver said, that leaves many questions as to whether McChrystal can effectively corral Democrats to stick with him into the general election, all the while his former vice president, now general election opponent, runs a scorched earth campaign.</p><p>“McChrystal commanded a very formidable performance in 2012, a modern electoral landslide, over 350 electoral votes,” he said. “But now he's totally threw whatever coalition he had then into the air and is trying to run something completely different four years later. It's very difficult to ascertain the likelihood he comes out of this intact.”</p><p>The McChrystal-Flynn ticket is currently ahead of the Perry-Rubio one by 3 points in Silver's model. A 3 point lead is not safe enough in Silver's model, even if he still gives McChrystal a two-thirds chance of retaining the White House.</p><p>The <i>FiveThirtyEight</i> editor-in-chief defended his projection model from critics who say it should take into account early-voting data.</p><p>“I would be a little bit careful,” he warned of those numbers. “Republicans in 2014 told themselves a lot of stories about how they would be saved by the early vote and fell short of expectations in the midterm [congressional elections]. I wouldn't count out the odds that the tables have turned now, I mean the president's party certainly has, after all, but, we'll certainly see.”</p>\n\n",

            "description": "<i>Somehow nominated despite being electable.</i><br><br>With your ambassadorship scheme a bust, Jon Huntsman has officially entered the race for president. If your foreign policy proves a disaster, he will doubtless be the one to face you this November.<h3>Prospective Primary Bid Could Pose Trouble for President Huntsman's Reelection | <i>The Des Moines Register</i> | Politics</h3>\n              <p><small>OCTOBER 9, 2015 • 1:21 PM EST</small></p><p>By Phil Johnson</p><p>For the entirety of Jon Huntsman's time as president, and even before, he has been at odds with the right-wing of the Republican party. Glenn Beck galvanized conservatives in 2012, and, as explored in Don Gonyea's recent book, <i>Fracture: The Schism Within the Republican Party</i>, mobilized conservative resistance to Huntsman to much fanfare. However, after rising star on the Republican right Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who managed to win the 2015 CPAC straw poll over the incumbent Huntsman, declined to participate in the 2016 primary, along with Jim DeMint of South Carolina, social conservatives are turning to firebrand representative and native son to the Hawkeye State, Steve King, who has recently flirted with possibly launching a renegade bid that'll challenge Huntsman for the nomination.</p><p>Huntsman has predominately focused his efforts on emphasizing his moderation and foreign policy achievements throughout his tenure in D.C., although his presidential campaign has taken a notable shift following King's rumored entry. His campaign material has regularly touted Huntsman's fiscal record, both as president and during his time as governor of Utah, in far frequent occurrences in recent months, as well as his efforts to promote monetary responsibility in Washington. Of most consequence, Huntsman's successful brokering of a deal to minimize spending increases while also avoiding a government shutdown back in 2013. Though, this has in recent years become a point of contention that the president may have “sold out” his principles, at least, if comments by Cruz and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama are anything to go by.</p><p>Some reporters, such as our own Richard Conner, have speculated that Rep. King is to test the waters of discontent with Huntsman within the Republican base, possibly paving the road for a stronger conservative challenger. His odds are long, so long it is already being mocked as doomed to fail by some on Capitol Hill, especially among allies to the president like Senators Lindsey Graham and Jeff Flake, who've openly talked down such furor that has been bubbling in the GOP. There exists speculation, too, that King may just skip the primary race altogether in acknowledgement of his chances, and take his discontent to the general in a bid to succeed Beck's 2012 run as an independent candidate. Whether the congressman pulls the trigger or not is still unconfirmed, but he'll need to decide soon, as window to become an eligible candidate for the Republican nomination will close by the end of the month.</p><p>Neither the Jon Huntsman's campaign nor the congressional office of Steve King could be reached for comment.</p><p><b>RELATED STORIES</b></p><p><u>In a Crowded Contest, Sherrod Brown Continues to Lead the Pack as Frontrunner</u></p><p><u>Ohio Senator Rob Portman Affirms “Unequivocal Support” For President</u></p><p><u>North Carolina's Pat McCrory Takes Swing at Huntsman, Expresses Hope for “Ruckus” in Primary</u></p><p><u>President Huntsman's Free Trade Program Continues to See Dip in Popularity: CNN Poll</u></p>",

            "description": "<i>Crying manly conservative tears.</i><br><br>Displeased by your response to the Arab Spring, former Fox News personality Glenn Beck has been compelled to launch his own candidacy in his belief the Republicans are ill-equipped to get the job done.<h3>Princeton students rallied around a cause of social justice, and they found an unexpected ally in President Beck | NBC | News</h3>\n              <p><small>Students brought change to their campus following an uptick in racial injustice over the summer, and President Glenn Beck emerged as an unlikely ally in their fight</small></p><p><small>August 27, 2016, 12:55 PM EDT / Updated August 27, 2016, 2:53 PM EDT</small></p><p>Students at Princeton University saw success after they had protested for the removal of former U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's name from the university's prestigious School of Public and International Affairs due to his “racist thinking and policies.” Student activists also occupied the university president's office last year demanding the change be made, where Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber <span style=\"color:lightblue;\">agreed that the president was racist</span>, but also argued contributions that he made should be weighed in equal measure.</p><p>Wilson was president of Princeton from 1902 to 1910 and served as New Jersey's governor from 1911 to 1913. Though a progressive, Wilson also supported the Lost Cause of the Confederacy and segregation, including appointing Cabinet members who segregated federal departments. About 30 Black and white students, from a group called the Black Justice League, took part in the protest, demanding a range of changes to improve the social and academic experience of Black Princeton students, including the removal of Wilson's name from the campus.</p><p>A review board ruled in favor of removing Wilson's name, alongside a host of other changes that were passed in acknowledgement of the students' demands, but an unexpected voice was there on behalf of the students the entire time, that of President Glenn Beck.</p><p><span style=\"color:lightblue;\">Writing an official statement prior to the review board's decision Tuesday</span>, Beck said “the administration backs wholeheartedly efforts by the student populace to remove President Wilson's name from the campus premises,” adding, “we urge Princeton University trustees to consider recognizing the voices of students of color and to take measures necessary to push for real change. Avoiding discussion of the president's policies, he was a vicious racist, and as the administration to succeed Wilson 100 years to the date, we urge progress be made in rectifying this.”</p><p>The statement of support should come as no surprise, as the president has had a long history denouncing Wilson, though mainly in relation to policies he implemented that would enlarge the federal government. Indeed, the Federalist Society also gave their two cents, commending the students for their work in removing Wilson's presence from Princeton: “<span style=\"color:lightblue;\">Asking a private school to stop honoring an authoritarian hatemonger who also happened to be one of the most destructive presidents in the history of the United States is about the sanest thing we've heard happening on a college campus in a long time.</span>”</p><p>Though he might have political reasons in siding with the students, many on the conservative side of the aisle have noticed the president adopting what some have called a new leaf when it comes to social issues. His recent appearance at CPAC earlier this year had to end about a half-hour before it could properly finish after Beck began to advocate in favor of Black Lives Matter, urging conservatives to “see things from their perspective,” which garnered <span style=\"color:lightblue;\">a chorus of boos in response</span>.</p><p>Though Beck has walked back his comments since, saying he “doesn't support them because they're a divisive, anti-Israel organization,” the view that the president has fallen far short of expectations when it came to what a new, bold brand of conservatism should look like continues to plague him. Elected in a shock after Jon Huntsman and Republicans in Congress agreed to cut a deal and propel Beck and Haley to the White House, it had been anticipated the transaction of power would fall in hardline conservatives' favor, but the president's low favorabilities suggest otherwise.</p><p>Beck has found it quite difficult retaining alliances or advantages in the world of Washington since; whether it be his ongoing feud with The Drudge Report or anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist, <span style=\"color:lightblue;\">who the president accused of being an agent of the Muslim Brotherhood</span>, or an inability to transfer some of that moderate appeal over with Haley, who is still licking her wounds after <span style=\"color:lightblue;\">her interview with Matt Lauer last year</span> where she said the Confederate flag had been “hijacked” in the aftermath of the Charleston church shooting, Beck is no stranger to the many perils the presidency brings. All the more reason, as has been suggested, that Beck has held true to his one-term pledge, though he claims that was always a personal, and not a political, decision.</p>",

            "description": "<i>Hollywood elite, but one of the good ones.</i><br><br>Answering the call of those in need of a champion in our darkest hour, Clint Eastwood has succumb to the goading of libertarian bankrollers and conservative fear-mongers in a Hail Mary plot to liberate America.<h3>President Eastwood Announces Official Defection to the Libertarian Party | News | CBS News</h3>\n              <p>Nina Elliott - Published December 13, 2013 at 8:45 AM EST</p><p>In a move that has stunned both Washington and the entire landscape of American politics, President Clint Eastwood formally announced yesterday that he is leaving the Republican Party and joining the Libertarian Party. The 83-year-old actor-turned-politician, elected in 2012 as the nominee of both Republicans and Libertarians, said that his first year in office convinced him “the two-party system is nothing but a crooked poker game, and I don’t like being dealt from the bottom of the deck.”</p><p>The official announcement came in unconventional fashion. On Thursday evening, the White House released a 12-minute short film directed by Vice President David Lynch, featuring Eastwood alone in a dimly lit Oval Office, speaking directly into the camera between cuts of barren highways, rattling ceiling fans, and a flickering neon “OPEN” sign. In the film, Eastwood declares that he can no longer associate with the Republican Party in good faith and reaffirms his allegiance to the Libertarians, calling the move “a return to the principles of individual freedom, limited government, and personal responsibility.” The video ended with Eastwood staring into the camera for a full 45 seconds before muttering: “I tried it their way. Now I’m doing it mine.” In its first 24 hours, the video amassed 52 million views, sharing the site’s record for the most views in that timeframe.</p><p>In a White House press conference held the following day, President Eastwood opened with an acknowledgment of the situation: “Last night you all saw it online. Today, to remove any doubt, you’ll hear it from me. I’m done with the Republican Party. I’m a Libertarian only now. And if anyone has a problem with that… well, that’s politics.”</p><p>From there, instead of expanding on his decision, he instead immediately opened the floor to a question-and-answer session. When asked by CNN’s Brianna Keilar where he thought the GOP had drifted away from him, Eastwood squinted and said, “A man’s got to know his limitations.”When Keilar followed up by asking if he believed his departure would weaken the GOP in future elections, Eastwood replied “Ever notice how once in a while, you come across someone you shouldn’t have fucked with? That’s me. If the Republican Party wanted to keep me in the fold and keep winning, then they should’ve shown that they’d dedicated the good government rather than trying to screw you and me.”</p><p>When pressed by Fox News’ Chris Wallace on whether his economic policies would shift under the Libertarian banner, Eastwood leaned into the microphone and uttered: “Do you feel lucky? Well, do you?” This quote left the room in silence for about 20 seconds before Eastwood finally elaborated: “Do you feel lucky enough to keep your own money, lucky enough to make your own choices? That’s the kind of economy I want. When a man’s got money in his pocket, he begins to appreciate peace.”</p><p>The reporters’ reactions constantly alternated between abject frustration and befuddled amusement as Eastwood oscillated between giving direct, coherent answers and lines lifted from his six-decade film career. Asked about his approach to foreign policy, he responded, “Dying ain’t much of a living, boy.” After a beat, he then clarified: “What I mean is, endless wars don’t profit this country. We’ve been living in death for too long. I’m not interested in empire-building. It doesn't do us any good spending money like that, and it sure as hell doesn’t do the Middle Eastern kid who got gunned down by Blackwater any good.”</p><p>At several points, Vice President Lynch, who was standing next to Eastwood’s side, chimed in, eventually taking his own questions abd confirming that he and Eastwood were “completely simpatico.” “Think of America as a giant log,” he said at one point. “The bark is rough, but inside there’s golden sap. Clint wants to let that sap flow. Republicans want to sand the bark smooth. Democrats want to paint it. Neither is the truth.” The remark drew visible bewilderment from several correspondents, with one loudly whispering, “What the fuck does that even mean?”</p><p>Beyond the theatrics, however, Eastwood’s message was clear. He cited frustration with both parties’ handling of civil liberties, surveillance, and government spending, though he saved his harshest criticism for the GOP. “I didn’t come here to babysit lobbyists, and I certainly didn’t come here to pad budgets. I came here, out of a very fulfilling film career, to keep the government out of people’s lives so it could focus on what it does best, so the people could focus on what they do best. And the GOP doesn’t seem to understand that anymore. They think they somehow deserve me acting a certain way. Well, guess what: deserve’s got nothing to do with it.”</p><p>He accused congressional Republicans of “clinging to the past,” citing their opposition to abortion and gay marriage as major points of contention with his Oval Office, as well as expressing frustration with Congress’ lack of action following the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting. “Just because I’m a libertarian, people think that I must be in favor of letting everyone carry RPG’s, or that I think we should let mentally ill loners buy assault rifles. Part of responsible government is being responsible.”</p><p>Eastwood saved criticism of Democrats as well, accusing them of being “only in it for a few liberals,” presenting libertarianism as the only path forward for his administration. “I’m not beholden to elephants or donkeys,” he quipped. “I ride my own horse.”</p><p>The president also rejected speculation that his departure from the GOP would cripple his ability to govern. “Let them try to box me in,” he said. “They’ll find out I don’t fit in a box. I’m the president and Congress is Congress. That’s what it is. There’s no rule that says all 535 people there have to act a certain way just because they have a D or an R next to their name.”</p><p>Reaction was swift. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), who has repeatedly clashed with Eastwood over budget negotiations, called the move “a betrayal of the party that put him in office,” comparing the President to “a modern-day Souter.” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) was more measured, saying that “The President has made his choice. We’ll continue to work with him when possible, and oppose him when his policies and priorities are not aligned with ours.”</p><p>Democratic leaders, on the other hand, appeared torn between seizing an opportunity to exploit Republican disarray and condemning Eastwood’s libertarian shift as an irresponsible upending of the political system. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) was quoted as saying, “The President’s theatrics are genuinely quite entertaining, but the country needs serious leadership. I’m still unconvinced that he can provide it.”</p><p>In stark contrast, Libertarian Party officials were jubilant. The party issued a formal statement declaring, “For the first time in history, the President of the United States is a Libertarian. Clint Eastwood has brought our message of individual liberty, non-interventionism, and limited government into the White House. This is a transformative moment, and we look forward to further supporting the President.” Later in the day, a Libertarian Party spokesman claimed that party registration and donations had spiked overnight, calling it “the beginning of a new party system.”</p><p>In the White House, though, the president refused to make any grandiose statements. As the press conference’s final question, Reuters’ Caren Bohan asked Eastwood point blank: “Mr. President, how do you respond to critics who say this is all just theater? How do you plan to deal with them?” Eastwood paused, adjusted the microphone, and narrowed his eyes before responding. “Go ahead… make my day.”</p>",

            "description": "<i>Let's see him catch these Gifted Hands.</i><br><br>'Mr. Fix-Some-Babies' has gone from neurosurgeon to Evangelical wingnut to nominee after Eastwood\\'s sudden exit. It's almost tragic enough to feel sorry for him, but not enough. This should be easy.<h3><i>Time</i> Person of the Year 2019: President Ben Carson | Profile | <i>Time</i></h3>\n              <p>Ben Carson does sleep. He sleeps because he’s got the country working like a well-oiled machine.<br><br>At 8:30 AM, he is in the shower. By 12:00, back bacon, sausages, eggs, fried tomatoes and mushrooms, baked beans, grits, buttered toast, and orange juice—all pulp. By 1:00, he’s spoken to HHS Secretary Mehmet Oz, Surgeon General Phil McGraw, and Chairwoman for the Presidential Council for Psychological Therapy, Crystals and Homeopathy Marianne Williamson (“<u><span style=\"color:lightblue;\">I don’t agree with Mr. President on all things, certainly</span></u>,“ she says, ”but I’m impressed by his talents, and to deny serving my nation? Never.“) via Skype, phoned into CBN to give <i>The 700 Club</i> the daily scoop, and mass emailed an auto-response to foreign leaders letting them know he’s watching, always watching. By 6:00, he is giving a speech in the Rose Garden, repeating with smooth and precise clarity prewritten speeches that had already been hand-delivered to attending reporters three hours earlier. By 9:15…always…9:15…on the dot…he is back in the Oval Office, finishing a pirate ship in a glass bottle. By 10:00, back to sleep.<br><br>How does someone in such an important position, demanding around-the-clock, 24-hour alertness manage to have so much free time? For Carson, a former neurosurgeon, a Christian man, an architect of the new and improved Food Decahedron, is presiding over a system not managed by him, but by his second-in-command. In another world, this would trigger alarm bells or be a closely guarded secret. But in this one, no. The American people, having experienced catastrophic governance from an egomaniac gone mad with power with a throbbing lust for celebrity, fame, and fortune, they have rallied not to ideology, not to party, but to <i>serendipity</i>.<br><br>It is governance as poetry, it rhymes. From an arrogant man to a modest and humble man, both in the White House. Also they’re both black.<br><br>And so, the president sleeps.<br><br>But even so, the health of the nation is in good hands. In just weeks, the administration has injected $250 billion into the healthcare system, nationalized the fast food industry, and compiled an <u><span style=\"color:lightblue;\">unprecedented joint-healthcare and food stamps initiative</span></u> aimed at preventing mass poverty and inability to access medical treatment. The National Institutes of Health, acting as the administration’s silent partner (and syringe), has slashed obesity rates to near zero, while a network of emergency healthcare facilities has been extended to rural areas that once swore they needed no such thing. The sheer force of the response has immediately halted popular perceptions of Americans being ugly, fat people internationally.<br><br>But this is not merely a domestic effort. Global health has been endangered in real time, and President Carson is at the center of it. The past week alone has seen direct intervention into the production of virality testing and creation of biohazardous substances on the world stage and diplomatic pressure on China to shutter their Institute of Virology in Wuhan. Even North Korea’s Kim Jong-un has taken the situation seriously, and lost what experts are guessing to be 100 pounds since the groundbreaking brokerage of peace between the hermit kingdom and the United States under Secretary of State Pat Toomey. There is, for the first time in years, a singular belief in American leadership, not just in health, not just in diplomacy, not just economically, but in literally everything. There is no ‘but’ or ‘though’ to that statement, it is in literally everything.<br><br>At home the politics have now shifted underfoot. The Democratic Party is grasping for footing, the Buttigieg/Booker ticket ultimately has been unable to reconcile any ideological frustrations they have, and the campaign is nonexistent because nobody goes to their rallies. The party’s once unshakeable foundation has collapsed under the full brunt of their weight because party supporters refuse to abide by Carson’s expertly-crafted health guidelines. Even longtime skeptics of Carson such as Senators Schumer and Tim Kaine, have signaled their support. The ideological ground has gone soft beneath their feet. This is not a moment for calories. This is a moment for fasting and daily exercise.<br><br>Vice President Rubio, ever the disciplined disciple, is the steadying hand. Where the stoic and measured president speaks in precision, in broccoli flows and celery stick infusions, Rubio speaks in lives, in futures, in dispelling the fiction of the nation’s past failed leader. <i>He knew exactly what he was doing.</i> It is a partnership forged by necessity but refined by mutual respect; a bromance, if you will. The storied doctor and the budding understudy, fused into a single governing force.<br><br>For now, the American people believe, with some polls putting his approval rating around 100% going into November, an astronomical figure in modern politics. It is not ideology that guides it. It is not loyalty. It is something more primal. It is full-on adoration and zealous worship. That we’ve elected literal deities who’ve stepped down from Mount Olympus and like Prometheus before them granted us the privilege to discover what a truly great and perfect America looks like.<br><br>The global health situation, despite their volatility and persistently precarious situation, has not cratered. The arteries of the average American, battered and weak, is no longer clogged. Congress, however reluctantly, has followed Carson’s lead. There is a prevailing sense on the Hill, in boardrooms, at kitchen tables, in concert halls, in mens’ lavatories, in airplanes, underwater, in the air, underground, in space, in your walls, that the sheer mass of his response, the vastness of his knowledge, and the force of his intervention has been enough.<br><br>This is a fact that doesn’t need corroboration, it just is.<br><br>In the West Wing, the lights are always off. The pace remains relaxed. In meeting rooms, in hallways, in phone calls, staffers don’t speak, they’re at home with their friends and families on paid-leave.<br><br>And in private, Carson is eyes-shut. He knows what has been done. He knows what there is left to accomplish, that being nothing, and he understands the love for him is vast, the enormity of the warmth is enough to set him ablaze if he ever touches it. When asked in passing by an aide whether things are finally settling, whether the Obamanation is at an end, he barely looks up from his pirate ship in a bottle of glass.<br><br><i>”Yeah, we’re good.”</i></p>",

How’s it goin’, Mister Zombie President Reagan? It’s been a while since I’ve seen you. Last time, you were… dead ‘n all, in the Rotunda.</p><p>Zombie Reagan: It’s been quite an adjustment. You know, waking up in the morning, brushing what’s left of my teeth, looking in the mirror and realizing the fellow looking back doesn’t exactly have a pulse. But the White House is still the same old house, just a little more modern. Awfully big place, especially when you can only move in a light shuffle.</p><p>Bush: Heh, yeah, I hear ya, Ronnie. I used to wake up in this place thinkin’, “Dang, I hope I don’t break the dishes again.” Place is bigger’n a rodeo barn. You get lost much?</p><p>Zombie Reagan: Oh, I still get turned around in the West Wing now and then. But when you moan, they clear the hallway right quick. It’s a good arrangement.</p><p>Bush: Yeah, that was me coming in here, making a big ruckus in my good boots. They squeak when I walk, but Mama says that means they’re fresh.</p><p>Zombie Reagan: You know, Nancy used to tell me the same thing about my shoes. Now, it’s the joints, too, but what can a man like myself do, right? Say, how’ve you been adjusting to, well, to not being in the big chair anymore? How did you manage that, uh, African-American fellow?</p><p>Bush: Oh, I been fine. Been clearin’ brush, eatin’ Tex-Mex, paintin’ pictures of dogs. Folks say they’re real good. Some folks say they’re not. I tell ‘em, “Well, that’s just… uh… art stuff.”</p><p>Zombie Reagan: Well, that’s the spirit. You know, it’s all about optimism. A sunny outlook. Even when your jaw falls off in Cabinet meetings, you’ve got to see the bright side of the afterlife.</p><p>Bush: Gee whiz. Do they clap when that happens?</p><p>Zombie Reagan: Sometimes. Other times, if they’re not expecting it, they scream. But you learn to take the good with the bad. After all, if you can’t laugh at rigor mortis, what can you laugh at?</p><p>Bush: Heh, that’s good, that’s real good. I’ll write that down for later. Laura will love it.</p><p>Zombie Reagan: Now, George, I asked you here today because I wanted to share a little something the Pentagon’s been cooking up. You see, ever since I returned, they’ve been showing me all the new toys. And by golly, this one… well, this one really makes the ol’ Strategic Defense Initiative look like a water pistol.</p><p>Bush: Oh boy. I love toys. I remember Star Wars.</p><p>Zombie Reagan: That was a joke name. If they’d taken me seriously, we’d be living in paradise. Imagine, George: no Russians, crack in every ghetto, tasty brains on every corner. But this, well, this might be even better.</p><p>Bush: A better toy, huh? I remember how I had some of them plastic army men that melt when you put a firecracker in ‘em, and how I didn’t play with those as much when I got a BB gun.</p><p>Zombie Reagan: Well, it’s not too far off from that. It’s a device… a weapon, George. The brightest minds at DARPA and a few necromancers in the basement put their heads together. And they came up with this.</p><p>Bush: Wait, we got necromancers now? Rummy and Cheney never told me about those.</p><p>Zombie Reagan: Oh no, it’s quite a new investment. Lots of amazing things can happen when you increase the Pentagon’s budget by 8000%. As it turns out, magic is real. Bigfoot isn’t, but the Loch Ness Monster is. And so is this gun in my hands.</p><p>Bush: Does it shoot as well as my ol’ BB did?</p><p>Zombie Reagan: Even better. It lets me reach right into a man’s noggin and–pop!–pull out his brain like a rabbit out of a hat.</p><p>Bush: Holy smokes. That’s like magic. Can you eat the brains after?</p><p>Zombie Reagan: Well, that depends on your appetite. I prefer mine with ketchup, but Nancy always said I should cut down on the cholesterol.</p><p>Bush: I like my food with barbecue sauce. Heh. Do you think we could bottle that up and sell it? “Reagan and Bush’s Brain BBQ.” Folks’d literally eat that right up. We could do a promotion, have ‘em use it in the concessions at Rangers games.</p><p>Zombie Reagan: Maybe, but really, well, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. The real beauty here is control. You take a man’s brain, and he can’t argue with you. He can’t vote against you. Why, you could run a whole country without a single debate.</p><p>Bush: That sounds mighty convenient. I never did like debates. Folks kept sayin’ I lost ‘em. But I won the election, so who’s laughin’ now?</p><p>Zombie Reagan: Exactly, exactly. And, well… I thought I’d give you a little demonstration.</p><p>Bush: A demo? Like them infomercials on the TV? “But wait, there’s more!”</p><p>Zombie Reagan: Heh, that’s right, George. Now hold still, this won’t hurt a bit.</p><p>Bush: Uh, should I sit, or stand? How still should I be?</p><p>Zombie Reagan: Just, uh… just stand there and smile. That always worked for you before.</p><p>Bush: Okay. Here comes my smilin’ face. I gotcha.</p><p>Zombie Reagan: Now, I just activate the switch here, aim it at your forehead… and pull.</p><p>Bush: Whatcha pullin’, sir?</p><p>Zombie Reagan: Hm. That’s odd. Nothing came out. Let’s try again. C’mon, come on outta there…</p><p>Bush: Hey, is it supposed to make that buzzin’ noise? Sounds like one of them weed-whackers.</p><p>Zombie Reagan: No, George… there should be something in there. A brain, at least the size of a walnut. Everyone has one, more or less.</p><p>Bush: Well, Poppy always said I was a special case. Teachers said the same thing.</p><p>Zombie Reagan: No, this can’t be. It worked on Bork, after all. Even there, I got a little something out of it. Not that it was very tasty, mind you, but… unless…</p><p>Bush: Unless… I ain’t got one of them brains?</p><p>Zombie Reagan: That’s exactly what I’m saying, George. I came here to demonstrate the pinnacle of modern warfare, maybe get a good meal in with it, and all I’ve proven is that you’re… well… maybe your father was right about you after all.</p><p>Bush: Heh. That explains why my head feels so light sometimes. I had just thought it was the humidity.</p><p>Zombie Reagan: I had thought that your father would be able to take the loss of another child–I mean, God knows that the last one didn’t impact him much–but it turns out that you might be slightly useful.</p><p>Bush: Aw, shucks. That’s the nicest thing a zombie president ever said to me.</p><p>Zombie Reagan: I mean, think of it. You’re immune to my weapon. Invincible. No brain to steal, no thoughts to corrupt. Just a former president living his best life.</p><p>Bush: Does that make me, uh… what’s the word… patriot?</p><p>Zombie Reagan: Heh, well, let’s call it “unique.” Since I came back from the grave, you’re the most interesting specimen I’ve met. The least appetizing, too, but I guess I can push lunch back until one of those staffers comes by.</p>",

The demagogic liar has succeeded in advancing himself to the highest office in the land on the premise he'd fulfill the hopes and channel the grievances of all the extremists and victims who've placed him there. Under the ever-present eyes of his teachers, the time has come to take his place as the fourth horseman of the apocalypse that will ring in a new America.<br><br>Tasked with defining himself and exposing his innermost ambitions, he must act upon events most extraordinary, all conveniently placed before him as if by the cruel hand of fate itself before Pandora's Box inevitably opens. Once the chaos is unleashed, savaging Americans on all fronts, it is up to Obama to decide how to fuck up this great nation. Will he maintain the radical tutelage instilled in him from his swinging Chicago days, or betray them all at the risk of a tarnished legacy? Whatever he decides to do, it'll take all his wits, snake oil charm, and manipulative cunning to not go down with the ship he's sinking.",

Now you sit alone in the Oval Office, ready to see the expected places to fall.<br><br>What comes begins as profound disappointment. First, New York held on. Embers of blue kept on burning, holding against your tide. One state after another tips in that fifth columnist's favor, and after a long, long evening, with so many states too close to call, she hits the magical 270. You were alone in your room but it felt like all of America watched on with you in sheer horror. The most deafening silence stormed the room.<br>You can't seem to hold yourself back. In one slobbering movement, you throw the lamp from your desk to the floor, the shattering glass echoing through the room. You try desperately to understand how things got to this point. There was no way Jane Fuckin' Fonda had won against a man with a proven record. Something had to be seriously, seriously wrong with the mental state of this country.<br>Hours go on before you accept any pager messages, calls, or even offers of beverages or food. You feel a ball of fire consuming your new heart. There is no fucking way this just happened.<br><br>Lynne calls. Holy mother of God. What a disappointment of a husband you are.<br>“Hey, Dickie. You okay?”<br>“I love you, Lynne. Forgive me.”<br>You close the phone before she can respond.<br>You're not going to let this go. You're not going to let your wife down like this, you bumbling piece of shit. This is not going to be the end.<br><br>Rummy's phone rings.<br><br><b>“Gather before the crack of dawn.”</b></p>`,

Your hair, whispy as it is, was falling down your chest as you stumble over to turn on your laptop and watch the election results -- after all, you had to. It was your reckoning.<br>First it was Colorado. Called for a Democrat for the first time since '92, and before that for the first time Goldwater, you felt your throat ache. Terrible sign, but not totally unexpected.<br>States would fall far, far past partisan lines. States which hadn't been competitive in 50 years had suddenly become neck-and-neck, and over time the map became a scintillant blue. The final EV tally was apocalyptic: Not even triple digits. Hell, it had barely reached double digits.<br><br>You sunk into your chair. There was nothing to do anymore but rot in a disgraced retirement for the rest of your twilight years and sink into your pain.<br>Breathing was tight and shallow. It's hard to think when you can barely see around you. Need to get the fuck out of here. I need to get the fuck out of here. I need to get the fuck out of here.

You jump out, almost too fast for your security guards, and storm into the Oval Office. With an energy you haven't felt in years, you prepare everything, turn on the TV, and settle into your chair.<br>You're just in time. The screen flashes that the decisive state will take you over the magical 270 mark - barely a minute after you turn it on. You sit back, hands in your lap, and enjoy the moment. But it's not just a victory - it's a triumph.<br>The numbers keep rising. 300, 320, 349 electoral votes and beyond. Each new state that turns red seems to give you more power. You can reshape the political landscape in your mind's eye, with you at the top, unchallenged.<br>When it is finally announced that the Republicans have flawlessly gained control of both houses of Congress, you are overcome by a feeling of immense relief. You know the next few years will be easier than you ever imagined. The stage is set for your vision of America.<br>This vision will stay with you for the next four years, and if your health is still good, maybe even other positions. Your daughter Liz spoke to you and said that she is very interested in your job from now on and is thinking about whether she could perhaps achieve this goal in 2016, 20, or even 24.<br>You assure her that it will be very easy, with a mandate like this, many things will become easy, you add as you finally rise from your chair and look out the window of the Oval Office at the shining Washington D.C. and take a moment to take it all in.

A referendum on excellence. You didn't care how many of them were your diehard fans, what mattered more than anything in the World was the momentum. The rallies. The energy.

This surpassed every expectation in human history. The most perfect exercise of democracy. 100,000,000 eager, proud Cheney voters. Your achievement, outright cinematic and surreal in its perfect shape, would be remembered for centuries to come. And when America falls like the Romans once did, mighty and honorably, fighting at the outposts of Naples as Vesuvius bursts, your name will be whispered by dictators who will make it rise once more like a phoenix. God bless America, ever eternal, fair and perfect, all within the Referendum of Perfection.

It was a hard fought race, but you fought well.“</p><p>After clearing out the reporters, the two finally had a chance to speak to each other. One on one. The truth is the two had never met.

You decide to give, just before the polls close nationwide, a short but rousing speech on Constitutional government and steady leadership, which is received well.<br><br>As the evening goes along, the usual suspects collapse. Although you were hoping to embarass Gravel in deep-red Alaska, there was simply too much favorite-son energy going around in the state; it quickly falls to the Dem column for the first time since 1964.

The next states prove significantly more exciting; as places like West Virginia, Nevada, Colorado and Georgia lock in, you can only feel elated.<br><br>By the evening's end, it was crystal clear, even with a state or two too close to call: America had soundly rejected Mike Gravel's bizarre, idiosyncratic American left-pseudonationalism, and maintained the need for leadership under experienced, rational actors like you. As people party and celebrate, throwing open champagne bottles and hollering, you can only help but feel a little intrigued by how Gravel even managed to win the nomination of such a divided Democratic party.<br>Still, it didn't matter. You could get back to work and America would remain strong, for all time, defying these anti-war freaks and truly rebuilding itself after the pains of losing Dubya. Now, in your image, it can truly prosper for a long time.

The fact of the matter is that Cheney and his warmongering ilk would never matter again, and the Young Overcame as communes and peace-cities sprung up across the nation, headed by gurus, semi-Presidents and even nobody at all.

It's rumored that 5 or so votes in either direction in every precinct of a given state could've shifted the results, but ultimately, the magical 270 was reached by the bizarre amalgamation of Southern and Ancestral Democrats across Middle America, creating a truly fascinating sight of a realignment.<br>You see the Republicans in the crowd stop for a moment, at one point one of them even looks towards the Oval Office, shrugging to your window. Can he see you? It doesn't matter. The Republicans seemed to slowly concede their positions, patting the Democrats in the crowd in the back, congratulating them, giving handshakes. As people slowly realized what kind of friendships they were building, the Republicans had soon become willing to party too, seeing this as a victory for all of America.<br>Of course, the hardcore Christian Rightists were in their churches, speaking of treason to Christian Values through your "promotion of sodomites". You wonder who they voted for this election, but it doesn't really matter. They squander and rot in their own extremism, a ball of hatred that couldn't bear to see an America united in its perfect civilization against the forces of tyranny. If anything's to go by these results, you've etched a new camp of possibilities for Republicans and Democrats alike as party operatives scramble to find solutions and suitable analysis of the bizarre map.<br><br>You call Landrieu. She picks up pretty quickly and gracefully appreciates your comments.<br><br>You were supposed to feel defeated, angry, possibly even full of despicable negativity.

This action is a direct response to the serious threat posed by China's belligerent actions in East Asia and by demonstrated hostile attempts to subvert our institutions.<br>The January 15 declaration of war by the People's Republic of China and the subsequent escalation of military conflict in Korea have demonstrated that the national security of the United States is under imminent threat.

The crisis that began during the Cheney administration has deepened under subsequent governments.<br>In 2008, President Richard Cheney's administration accused European states of responsibility for the global financial crisis. These accusations, coupled with the decision not to support Ukraine during the Russian invasion that same year, led to a dramatic rupture in transatlantic relations.<br>The situation escalated further when NATO was effectively dissolved in 2009. Since then, the relationship between Europe and the US has been marked by distrust. A new low was reached when it was revealed that the Cheney administration had covertly supported the British “Vote Leave” campaign. This interference in the EU's internal affairs brought the UK to the brink of leaving the EU, which permanently destabilized Europe.<br>Tensions were exacerbated in the following years by military and economic conflicts. The European mercenary group "Atlantic Falcon", which allegedly carried out covert operations in Syria, was accused several times of attacking US positions in the Middle East. Although the EU Commission denied any connection to this group, numerous reports indicate indirect support.<br>The situation escalated in January 2021, when a skirmish broke out between the Atlantic Falcon group and the Russian Wagner group in Hama, Syria. Both mercenary groups then concluded a surprise ceasefire, prompting the US to launch Operation Desert Air. This large-scale airstrike resulted in an estimated 1,000 deaths and injuries on both sides and also targeted IS positions in the region.<br>The EU responded with strict economic sanctions against the US, particularly targeting the American automotive industry. President Trump, who took office in early 2017, responded with harsh words and the announcement of punitive tariffs of 30% on European goods.<br>Away from the major theaters, numerous smaller incidents also occurred, further straining relations. In Greenland waters, Danish fishing boats were forced to return several times by the US Navy. When Denmark rejected Trump's offer to buy Greenland, the president threatened to blockade the island. The European Navy then conducted extensive military exercises in the region.<br>During the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump accused the EU of 'flooding' the American market with European vaccines. As a result, he imposed a complete ban on imports of foreign vaccines and escalated the trade war that had already been going on for years.<br>After his re-election in 2020, Trump announced his intention to finally win the trade war against Europe. His administration is reportedly planning a series of new measures, including extensive subsidies for American industry and further punitive tariffs on European goods.<br>The EU, on the other hand, is working to strengthen its economic and military independence. With the joint European army, which has been operational since 2016, and new trade agreements with Asia and Africa, Europe is trying to minimize the impact of American policies.<br>Transatlantic relations are at an all-time low. While Russia and China benefit from the division of the West, the US and Europe are struggling to maintain their global positions. The question remains: is rapprochement still possible, or are we facing the final end of the transatlantic partnership?</p><br><br>See also:<br>_____<br><br>Why is seccesion in Quebec so popular again?<br>_____<br><br>Fort Alice (Taiwan) the largest US Military Base in Asia<br>_____<br><br>Why is there a Troop Surge in Kaliningrad?<br>`,

He was last seen just a day before the invasion, and since then his whereabouts have been a major mystery—one that has not only fueled political debate but also become a widespread meme on social media.<br>The question “Where is Assad?” has become not only a political mystery but also a major cultural phenomenon. The internet community has greeted the question with a mixture of skepticism and humor, giving rise to countless memes outlining various absurd theories about the Syrian president’s whereabouts. Some claim Assad has fled to Moscow, others believe he may be hiding in a remote corner of Latin America or China. There are also rumors that the Syrian president was captured by the US during the invasion - a theory that has never been confirmed.<br>In 2009, the newly formed Syrian interim government set up a commission to investigate the whereabouts of Assad and other high-ranking members of his regime. But despite intensive efforts, including by private investigators and intelligence agencies such as the CIA, there has been little success so far. However, it has been proven that the presidential palace in Damascus was abandoned shortly after the first American bombing and was probably evacuated by Assad himself.<br>The search for Assad has become a diplomatic challenge. In the years following his escape, there have been repeated alleged sightings, but these have never been verified. Particularly notable was an anonymous internet report that led to a CIA raid in Alexandria, Egypt. This ended in failure, however, which only increased speculation and frustration over his incomprehensible escape.<br>On social media, memes have become a staple of public discussion. The question "Where is Assad?" has long since gone beyond political events and has developed into a popular internet phenomenon. It is now repeatedly taken up in numerous forms, from humorous to satirical representations. The image of Assad living in a safe hiding place somewhere in the world has created its own cult figure in the digital space. The memes range from images showing Assad in exotic holiday destinations to speculative scenarios in which he acts as a secret leader of a resistance movement against the Western world.<br>The hunt for Assad is not only a question of the political power structure in the Middle East, but also has symbolic meaning. It represents the ongoing instability in the region and reminds us of the difficulties the international community faces in stabilizing a country in the long term after military intervention. The constant question of Assad's whereabouts remains an unsolved mystery that continues to dominate the headlines - and has simultaneously become the source of numerous parodies and speculations.<br>The international community is increasingly asking whether Assad's continued existence has not only a political but also a moral dimension. If Assad is indeed dead or captured, this could symbolize the end of a dictator. But if he is still alive, the question remains how the Western world and the Arab world would react. This uncertainty could continue to serve as a painful stain on international relations and a warning for future military interventions.</p>`,

Reports of war crimes against the civilian population and captured soldiers are circulating - things you don't really want to believe. I saw a comrade who preferred to take his own life rather than fall into their hands. It's hard not to sink into utter despair when you witness something like this.<br>Things don't seem to be going well at home either. The news coming in here is of nationwide riots, curfews, and a population on the brink of collapse. I hope you are somewhat safe in New York and that the unrest hasn't hit too close to home.<br>Please don't worry about me. I'm hanging in there, as are all of us here. But the truth is, I don't know how much longer we can hold on. This country, this war - it's changing us all. I just hope that one day we can all wake up from this nightmare unscathed.<br>Take care of yourselves. I think of you every day and hope that one day I can return home.<br><br>Love,<br>David</p>`,
    "riggedel": `<h3>CNN</h3><div style='overflow-y:scroll; height:270px;'><b>January 7, 2013</b><p>2008: ELECTION FRAUD?<br><br>In a few weeks, President-elect Joe Biden will be sworn in on January 20 in Washington D.C. after his overwhelming landslide victory of 330 electoral votes against incumbent President Dick Cheney. His victory marks a turning point in American politics, but questions have emerged in recent days that could cast the outcome of the 2008 election in a new light.<br><br>Democrats and political analysts have begun to cast doubt on the legitimacy of Dick Cheney's narrow re-election four years ago. That election, which Cheney won by less than 20 electoral votes, was already controversial at the time because he lost the popular vote despite winning the electoral college.<br><br>The latest doubts are based on reports of historically low voter turnout in several swing states, combined with irregularities reported by some election officials. Shortly before the election, polls showed a neck-and-neck race between Cheney and his Democratic challenger, which makes the close outcome even more explosive.<br>A particularly worrying point is the discrepancy between the number of voters in key states such as Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania. In these states, voter turnout was not only said to be unusually low, but anomalies in the counting were also reported, including technical errors and discrepancies in heavily Democratic districts.<br>So far, outgoing President Cheney has not commented on the allegations. But as early as 2008, voices were raised calling for a more detailed investigation of the electoral process. These were rejected at the time by the Republican majority in Congress, which is being criticized again today.<br>President-elect Biden said in a press conference that he was open to a comprehensive investigation of the allegations:<br>“Trust in our democratic process is the foundation of our republic. If there are doubts or irregularities, we must clarify them - for the people and for the future of our country.”<br><br>While Democrats push for transparency, some Republicans accuse critics of delegitimizing the outcome of the 2008 election to advance their own agenda. But analysts warn that unresolved doubts about the 2008 election could further exacerbate political polarization in the United States.<br>With Biden's inauguration and a new political era looming, the question of whether the 2008 election was truly fair and free is sure to continue to make headlines. If an investigation uncovers new evidence, it could have a lasting impact not only on Cheney but on the credibility of the entire electoral system.</p>`,
    "100evs": `<h3>CNN</h3><b>March 20, 2014</b><div style='overflow-y:scroll; height:270px;'><p>THE WORST BIRTHDAY IN THE WORLD: THE END OF THE GOP?<br>The Republican Party is facing the greatest crisis in its history - a crisis that seriously threatens its existence. The GOP's situation has steadily worsened since President Dick Cheney's devastating defeat in the 2008 presidential election. Back then, Cheney lost to his Democratic challenger by a historically low number of fewer than 100 electoral votes - a humiliating result that laid the foundation for a downward spiral.<br><br>In the years that followed, the party suffered a series of devastating defeats. Gubernatorial elections, congressional races and the 2012 presidential election all went to the Democrats. In the 2012 election, the Republican candidate again only achieved a disastrous number of 120 electoral votes, plunging the GOP into a severe financial and identity crisis.<br>But perhaps the most devastating blow came now, on March 20, 2014 - the party's 160th birthday. On that very day, it was announced that a major split had formed: the so-called Coalition to Make America Great Again (CMAGA). This new political movement consists of a merger of several factions, including the libertarian wing of the Republican Party, the Libertarian Party and the Reform Party, which rose to prominence in the 1990s under Ross Perot.<br><br>The GOP is divided between the traditional neoconservatives - led by figures such as Mitt Romney and John McCain - and an increasingly vocal faction of libertarian and protectionist hardliners around Russ Feingold. The conflict over the direction of the party has been visible for years, but only now have the tensions erupt in a formal split.<br><br>Paul Ryan, chairman of the Republican National Committee, reacted with an angry statement:<br>“This move is a betrayal of everything our party has stood for for 160 years. What they have done is nothing less than guaranteeing the Democrats unchallenged dominance for decades to come.”<br><br>There were also reactions from the ranks of the Democrats - mostly with a mixture of derision and satisfaction. Insiders report that several Republican representatives in the Capitol smiled ironically when they heard the news - a sign of resignation in the face of the worsening situation.<br><br>The Republican Party is at a turning point. Without clear leadership, with limited financial resources and a crumbling base, it could slide into insignificance - like other major parties in American history.<br>But the 2016 presidential election is approaching and, despite all the uncertainty, there is already speculation about possible candidates. The best known names include:<ul><li>• Donald Trump, the billionaire real estate magnate and reality TV star who could present himself as an outsider and mouthpiece for dissatisfied voters.</li><li>• Jesse Ventura, former wrestler and governor of Minnesota known for his populist and unconventional views.</li><li>• Russ Feingold, the libertarian favorite who could benefit from the split by positioning himself as a voice for limited government and personal freedom.</li></ul><br>The Republican Party has just two years to redefine itself and win back its base. Otherwise, it could suffer the same fate as other major American parties that have disappeared in the turmoil of political and societal change.<br>The next few weeks and months will be crucial - not only for the future of the GOP, but also for the political balance of the United States.</p>`,

However, I'm happy to answer your questions in the comments as far as my experiences are concerned.<br><br>Russia has been in a difficult economic state since the invasion of Georgia in 2008. In response to the conflict, the then US government under President Cheney not only imposed massive sanctions against Russia, but also took drastic and unprecedented action: numerous Russian oligarchs, CEOs and business leaders were arrested and their assets - including real estate, bank accounts and company shares - were frozen. These measures affected prominent names such as Roman Abramovich, Vladimir Lissin and Alexei Mordashov, who were among the most powerful men in Russia at the time.<br>The Russian government has always described these actions as a "terrorist act of hostage-taking," and to this day these events continue to cause considerable tension in international relations. The consequences were far-reaching: many of the imprisoned or dispossessed oligarchs returned to Russia after their release, but they lacked the financial influence they once had to regain their former position of power. This led to a real restructuring of the Russian economy and a bitter struggle between old and new players.<br><br>The current impact on the Russian economy<br><br>Russia has changed economically over the past nine years. Many of the once powerful corporations, especially in the oil and gas sector, have been replaced by new companies, often run by younger businessmen or former employees of the old guard. At the same time, established companies such as Gazprom or Rosneft are struggling with internal power struggles, corruption and inefficient administration.<br>On the political stage, President Putin appears increasingly weakened. He is caught between rival business magnates who are pressuring him to represent their interests. For example, conflicts between the factions of Igor Sechin (Rosneft) and Mikhail Gutseriev (Safmar Group) are no longer a secret.<br><br>The official unemployment rate in Russia is around 5%, but the shadow economy is growing rapidly, especially in regions such as the Caucasus and Siberia. At the same time, Western sanctions have cost the Russian economy around $30 billion annually, which has severely affected the willingness of the private sector to invest.<br>My experiences as an investor<br>Over the past two years, I have been to Moscow several times and have conducted small deals there as a private investor. Here are some of my observations and advice for anyone thinking about investing in Russia:<br><br>1. Don't expect stability:<br>Despite being extremely rich in natural resources, particularly natural gas, Russia is an unpredictable market. Changes in laws, sanctions and political unrest can devalue your investments overnight.<br>2. Stay small and discreet:<br>Big deals, especially in the energy, metal or technology sectors, are often characterized by corruption and political intrigue. If you want to invest in Russia, focus on smaller, locally oriented companies.<br>3. Be suspicious of “offers”:<br>During my time in Moscow, I regularly received mysterious letters and emails offering me lucrative stakes in Russian companies. Most of the time, such offers are part of scams or are designed to drag you into larger conflicts.<br>4. Be careful of the bureaucracy:<br>Russia is notorious for its bureaucratic apparatus. Without local partners or legal advisors, it is almost impossible to secure a long-term investment.<br>5. Avoid political topics:<br>Political statements or connections to controversial figures (be they pro- or anti-Putin) can jeopardize your position. In Russia, the less attention you attract, the better.<br>Russia remains a country full of opportunities, but also full of risks. Rivalries between oligarchs have made the economic and political landscape unstable. While it can still be profitable to invest in certain areas (e.g. agriculture or technology), investors should always be cautious.<br>I hope my experience will help you make an informed decision if you plan to invest in Russia. I'm happy to answer any questions in the comments.<br>Stay safe,<br>A Concerned Investor<br><br>1k⬆️     ⬇️</p> `,
  "iranchud": `<h3>CNN</h3><b>April 18, 2019</b><div style='overflow-y:scroll; height:270px;'><p>A DECADE AFTER THE AMERICAN INVASION: PSEUDO-NATIONS IN FORMER IRAN PLAGUED BY PROBLEMS<br><br>Ten years ago, after the assassination of former President George W. Bush by the Revolutionary Guard during a visit to Tbilisi, the Cheney administration launched the invasion of Iran. The aim of the operation was to destabilize Iran and bring the region under control by liberating ethnic minorities and creating new nation-states. But the ambitious plan turned into a geopolitical disaster, the repercussions of which are still felt today.<br><br>The regions of former Iran that were divided into several new states, such as Arabistan, Hormuz and the Republic of Lut, are suffering from massive economic and ecological crises. The region was hit particularly hard by a historic drought that began immediately after the withdrawal of US troops. Millions of people were pushed into poverty as agricultural land dried up and food became scarce.<br><br>The economic situation was further exacerbated by questionable contracts between the new nations and the American oil company Halliburton. In exchange for much-needed loans and financial aid, Halliburton took control of most of the region's oil fields. This meant that the new states could hardly benefit from their own resources, while American corporations made enormous profits.<br><br>Political instability is another pressing problem. The new states, originally planned as ethnic micronations, are struggling with ethnic tensions and conflicts between different population groups. Civil wars and violent power struggles characterize everyday life in Arabistan and Hormuz, while the Republic of Lut is shaken by constant uprisings.<br><br>The international community, especially the United Nations, has launched humanitarian aid programs, but the challenges on the ground are enormous. A 2018 UN report called the situation "one of the greatest political and humanitarian miscalculations in recent history."<br><br>The conflict has left deep scars in the United States itself. Critics accuse the Cheney administration of starting a war that was based on short-term strategic advantages but caused chaos and suffering in the long term. The question of responsibility for the wrong decisions of 2008 remains politically controversial to this day.<br><br>While the United States has since withdrawn from the region, the new micronations in former Iran remain isolated and economically weak. For millions of people, the promises of freedom and prosperity that once accompanied the American invasion have long since given way to a sense of hopelessness.<br>The world today looks with mixed feelings at the legacy of the American invasion of Iran - an invasion that shattered existing power structures but did not create viable alternatives. The question of whether the geopolitical price was worth the supposed gains remains one of the greatest open wounds in recent history.</p>`,
  "ww3slide3": `<h3>POLITICO</h3><br>December 19, 2024<br><div style='overflow-y:scroll; height:270px;'><b>TEN YEARS AFTER THE SHANGHAI TREATY - A SECOND CHINESE-AMERICAN WAR ON THE HORIZON?</b><p>The Shanghai Treaty brought an end to the devastating Sino-American War in 2014 - but with an outcome that permanently changed the world order. After the People's Republic of China seized Taiwan in 2013 and the Republic of Korea completely surrendered in 2014, the United States was forced to end the conflict. Internal uprisings against authoritarian martial law and the administration of President Dick Cheney in January 2014 significantly weakened the United States and ultimately forced it back to the negotiating table.<br>The consequences of the treaty were profound: Taiwan was finally integrated into the People's Republic of China, while North Korea conquered the South and unified the Korean peninsula under the rule of the Kim dynasty. These developments sealed an era of American power loss in the region and made Asia a de facto Chinese sphere of influence.<br><br>Now, ten years later, the administration of President Newt Gingrich has taken steps to regain lost influence. The establishment of new US naval ports in Okinawa and Nagasaki and the general militarization of Japan mark a clear turn in American strategy. Japan, once bound to pacifism by Article 9 of its constitution, finally abandoned this stance in 2016. Today, the country is a bastion of American presence in the Pacific, ready to face a possible conflict with China.<br>The Chinese government views these developments with growing concern. The expansion of American bases and Japan's growing military strength are seen in Beijing as a direct threat. In a recent speech, President Xi Junwei, Xi Jinping's successor, declared that 'Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity must not be challenged again.' At the same time, China has continued to strengthen its presence in the South China Sea and forged new military partnerships in the region, particularly with Russia and the unified Korea.<br>Meanwhile, the US and its allies are not sitting idle. The recently ratified Indo-Pacific Defense Pact unites the US, Japan, Australia and India in a strategic alliance designed to make it clear to Beijing that another conflict would not be without significant consequences for China. President Gingrich stressed in a speech to Congress: “We will not stand idly by while authoritarian regimes break the rules of the international order.”<br><br>But behind the scenes, concerns are growing that tensions could escalate again. Experts warn that another military confrontation between the US and China could seem inevitable if a diplomatic solution is not found. Historians compare the current situation to the situation before World War I: a world at bay but full of unresolved conflicts and national ambitions.<br>The Shanghai Treaty may have ended the first Sino-American war, but its consequences still resonate today. And as both superpowers arm themselves and strengthen their alliances, many are asking: Are we on the eve of a new conflict?<br>Only time will tell whether diplomacy can prevail – or whether the world will once again fall into the clutches of war, the consequences of which could be immeasurable.</p>`

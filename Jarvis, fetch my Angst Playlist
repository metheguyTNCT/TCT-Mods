Things like this don’t happen to you, When we… when everything…. Where were they? Your people? Why didn’t they show? How could they? After everything you’ve done for them, leave you here like this? It isn’t fair.</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Landslide<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"></span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Landslide<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"></span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Landslide<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"></span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The pundits behind their desks, they're ecstatic, vibrating, leering, drooling over the blown-up map, drowning you out. One by one, they sink the hatchet in deeper and deeper, gouging you. They lay it all out, explaining why Americans had so explicitly and horrifically denounced you and your feckless campaign, Trumpism they say is dead, a footnote, a bump in the road of liberal democracy. The Television flickers from MSNBC, where Joy Anne Reid wipes tears from her eyes in awe at the “Complete wholesale rejection of Trump” to CNN where Anderson Cooper recalls that he’s never experienced an election night quite like this one, “It was all downhill from the start” to Fox, those traitors throwing you under the bridge “Perhaps it was a mistake” says Baier “To ever let this man into national politics”. And then the T.V. clicks off, for the first time in a long while, silence echoes through the White House. </p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">HUGE LOSER…</span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">HUGE LOSER…</span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">HUGE LOSER…</span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><span style=\"padding-left: 5em;\"><strong>There’s got to be a way back from this, </strong> the illegal voters, yes. Millions and millions of them, stuffing ballot boxes across the country. Voting twice, three times, maybe more. And don’t forget the dead voters, coming out of the woodwork, they’ve done it before, don’t get fooled. And the voting machines, those things are completely rigged, you’ve seen it for yourself, you pull the lever and it switches, its fraud, complete and total fraud.</p>\n    <p>But it still doesn’t add up, how could they? Right across the country, right under everyone’s noses. Well, that was obvious, the news, the fake lying press, they covered it up, covered everything up, slandered you. We should sue, sue them, sue the states, sue everybody, we have to stop this. It’s a complete theft … the biggest fraud in history…</p>\n    <p>But it’s not just the press, it’s the voters, they’ve been duped, taken for a ride. They wouldn’t just do that to you, after everything you’ve done, they’ll come, if we tell them to, they’ll come. The theft is so blatant. As the eerie stillness pervades the White House, you can hear something, fireworks, not on the T.V. from outside the windows, across the whole city. The chanting, the singing, the dancing. Lighting up night skies of hundreds of cities, as millions join the festivities, while your supposed loyal people are nowhere to be seen, they’ve betrayed you, after all you’ve done for them.</p>\n    <p>The phones aren’t ringing, or maybe they are, but no one is answering. Why would they, the parties over, the skeleton staff that stayed through the entire horror show, the ones too dumb to look for another job weeks ago, are now too busy trying to remember this moment, no doubt for some tell-all book they'll write, ‘The End of Donald Trump’ That’s what they’ll call it. An attempt to get through to the RNC is aborted, after it’s leaked that the party is already plotting against you, to purge itself of your element, to deride you as a mere aberration, that the adults are back in charge. The Murdochs, the McConnels, and the McCarthy’s eager to use your final downfall to their benefit.</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">It’s Really Over …</span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">It’s Really Over …</span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">It’s Really Over …</span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Pence too, that soulless husk has completely flipped, another knife in the back, he wants out of your shadow, as if he could compete, eager to set himself up as the party successor, already hinting that it was he who had curbed your worst impulses, his office isn’t answering, if there’s going to be a speech, he won’t be there, he wants nothing to do with you; because you’re a loser. You lost.</p>\n    <p>That’s it, isn’t it? The whole thing, a big con job, your whole life, one epic tragedy, to take a man who never accomplished a damn thing without Daddy’s help and lift him up. To the highest of heights, a national spectacle, a global celebrity, the biggest brand there is. Only to destroy him and leave him with nothing, because that’s what you are really, deep down, nothing.</p>\n    <p>It's clearer than ever now, you can really see, It’s so obvious, it’s time, to give up. Concede, that will show them, it’s the last thing they expect, they want you to cry and pout on television, to talk about the rigging, and the fraud, and the witch hunts, well. Fuck’em. Let’s concede, thank our wonderful supporters and leave this whole rotten thing behind.</p>\n    <p>You’re out, it’s over. Just imagine, ‘ex-president’, there’s a lot of money to be made in that, and I could go anywhere, do anything, totally unconstrained, the kids, let them fight over what’s left, Melania she can stay in Florida, or leave, it doesn’t matter now.</p>\n    <p>The quickly drafted speech is placed in front of you, it’s good, short and sweet, they’ll love it. Gracious they’ll call you, very gracious.</p>",

It doesn’t make any sense. We were doing so well, nobody had seen anything like it, and everyone was saying it. The crowds—massive, unbelievable.

The experts were right, and you were wrong. Kornaki dances across the screen on MSNBC, flipping counties with his magical wand, red to blue, closing the pathways, shutting the door and trapping you inside. While Maddow's gleaming a smarmy sickly grin, while on Fox the word has come down from on-high as all those gutless empty suits stick the deeper knife inn, all while the presses were rolling out the fattest type fonts they could.</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">LOSER<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"></span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">LOSER<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"></span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">LOSER<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"></span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><span style=\"padding-left: 5em;\"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Robert ‘Beto’ O’Rourke, has been elected the 46th President of the United States. After 4 extremely turbulent years, Democratic primary voters and now the nation as a whole have turned towards a rising star within the Democratic party. Mr. O’Rourke a self-described ‘Punk Rock Democrat’, better known simply as Beto, has little in the way of political experience, he will be the first President since James Garfield whose greatest government experience was in the House of Representatives. But it was his long-shot 2018 Senate Race that distinguished him, with slick messaging, a charismatic candidate, enthusiastic supporters and a strong stream of donations, Beto turned a landslide loss, into a close-run thing. </p>\n    <p> Democrats desperate to defeat President Trump turned to Beto as a candidate who promised he could deliver just that. By driving up turnout among younger voters by channelling outrage at the failure of the U.S. government to prevent mass shootings which positioned gun rights as a key issue in this campaign. The Beto campaign also sought to spike turnout among Latino communities, through strong criticism of President Trump’s effort to build a wall on the southern border, these combined efforts making up BETO Method. An electoral coalition that appears to have been enough for President-elect O’Rourke</p>\n    <p>This can’t be happening, and your people, across the country. They can see it too, the greatest fraud in history, we were so close, how could we lose? Look at them, the energy, the unrelenting passion as they pound on the doors, and demand their votes be counted accurately, we have the real Americans. Who do they have? As if on cue, there they are, dancing, singing, reveling in their supposed victory. They think they’ve won, that it’s all over, that they can turn the page on you, shut you out, clog their ears. On CNN Anderson Cooper takes his viewers to a firework display in San Francisco as the crowd is illuminated under the red, white and blue spectacle, they’re in ecstasy, unshackled, free for the first time in years. </p>\n    <p><span style=\"padding-left: 5em;\"><strong>“BEE. EEE. TEE. OH!” </strong> The fans thumped out as the music throbbed out of the speakers. “BEE. EEE. TEE. OH!” It was a lively and passionate night, matching the lively and passionate spirit of the Beto campaign. Beto as a candidate could never be pinned down, the speeches were vibrant, bouncing from topic to topic, the rhetoric soaring, the applause frequent. “His heart was in it, all the way” said one supporter, “He’s really, really earnest, I knew from day one. He was going to be President, just look at him.” It seems like O’Rourke was able to capture the discontent of a generation, perhaps owing to his roots in punk rock himself, his rallies were festival-like, the issues themselves less important than his vigor for confronting them. “He’s real, he knows our country is f***ed up and isn’t afraid to say it”. Indeed, profane language has become a feature of this unadulterated campaign, and already some networks have been told to prepare to censor upcoming speeches of the candidates, but let’s hope it doesn’t come to that</p>\n    <p>The hollowed-out ghosts stalk you, clawing at you. Trying to understand what you are saying, directing your campaign staff to make phone calls, the Murdochs, McConnell, McCarthy. They‘re dismissive, their sniveling conniving voices betray their pitiful apologies “I’m sorry Mr. President”. Traitors, how could they do this, after all you’ve done for them? Don’t they see, we killed them, it’s over.</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">We Won<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">We Won<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">We Won<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Pence enters, his whimpering putrid smile plastered to his face, appears to be trying to console you, but you slap the words out of his mouth. We’re not going to get rolled, we’re going to fight, aren’t we, Yes! We have to fight. We have to. Mike’s face shifts, just a glint but you catch it, he’s spooked.</p>\n    <p>These cowardly, weak idiots. Are they blind, it’s obvious they’re stealing it. With the markers, and the blinders. They’re using the election against me. It’s rigged. They want me to concede well fuck them, we'll never concede.</p>\n    <p>Of these people only a few really get it Rudy, he sees it, it’s obvious, we have to declare victory. If we don’t, it’s over. We have to get out there and tell them, tell them to stop the count, stop the fraud, stop the steal.</p>\n    <p>The family try to hide themselves, those feckless disasters. Only Melania stays, watching the television, enraptured, muttering to herself in Slovenian.</p>\n    <p><span style=\"padding-left: 5em;\"><strong>Then the news comes through,</strong></p>\n    <p>Live shots from the DNC, Beto and Tammy are going to speak, even though we haven’t conceded. They can’t do that, they can’t. We have to get out there, we have to show everyone, that we’re up, that it's not over, it’s never over.</p>\n    <p>“Thank you, Thank you all. I love you all and am eternally proud of what you did tonight…”</p>\n    <p>“Everywhere I’ve been, and everything I’ve seen has only opened my eyes to the potential our country really has, and it’s amazing … ”</p>\n    <p>“Thank you. thank Amy, my children, thank Tammy, from the bottom of my heart thank you, you’ve made the impossible possible.…”</p>\n    <p>“It’s time to get to work now, saving this country, and saving this hemisphere, this planet even from the disasters ahead, but we can do it, I’ve no doubt that we can do it…”</p>\n    <p>“God bless you, and God bless America.”</p>\n    <p>We’ll be back, you say to yourself, America loves a comeback story...</p>",

This place, it's a joke, the marble columns, chandeliers, and paintings, it's all just cheap theatre, set dressing while all the real power lurks in the wings, commanding the lights, conducting the music, writing the lines. All these men, in the pictures and paintings, they all knew it too, and each played the part without question, actors playing the part.

Finally, when the room has been appropriately redecorated, and a modicum of composure rebuilt, do you realize, that the doors have completely vanished.</p>\n    <p>Where they once were the walls are smooth and bare, without any evidence of a door having ever been there, groping for a door handle results in nothing. Crossing over the other side of the room, there is similarly nothing, not even an outline, so you pound and wail and beg, but no one comes. No-one cares. How much time passes is uncertain, the clocks having been smashed so completely looking out the windows there is only a dark thick fog, that only reflects the oval prison you are trapped in.</p>",

The cameras struggle to find the opposite picture, the dejected Democrats, because they’re gone.

Trump has been re-elected President of the United States, after a daring and fiery 4 years, he has defeated the Democratic nominee Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who won the Democratic party nomination off the back of her foreign policy stance, which firmly opposed the President's favor of militaristic brinksmanship. Easily contrasting his own, fiercely unilateral visions of United States hegemony to Mrs. Gabbards embrace of isolationism and deference on the international stage.</p>\n    <p> After winning the party’s nomination, Candidate Gabbard struggled with internal bouts with establishment Democrats who were openly hostile to some of her policy stances. The Gabbard-Brown campaign eschewed a traditional campaign and instead focused on winning over disaffected Trump 2016 supporters, and motivating young voters to the polls by pointing to President Trump’s status as an existential threat to the world, citing the President's militarism, and the perceived nuclear threat, frequently citing that a second Trump administration might mean World War III. However, it seems this tactic has failed as the President was able to lean on these actions as patriotic and necessary compared to the supposed ‘cowardice’ of Gabbard. What does this mean for Gabbard going forward? Well come January she will not be a member of Congress and it is uncertain if she has a political future within the Democratic Party given her own attacks on the party’s upper echelons.</p>\n    <p>Your people, there they are, across the country, celebrating, chanting, reveling. Your victory is theirs; Your America is theirs, changed forever and this victory has calcified it, in the decades and centuries to come they will remember what you’ve done for your people, and all the haters will be long forgotten. And then finally the real show starts, the opposite picture, the petrified faces, glistening with tears, heads in hands, complete and utter despair, lost little lambs alone in the wilderness, the weakness that infests this country. On CNN Anderson Cooper describes the scene as he sees it, at an outdoor drive-in rally, they look like refugees, totally adrift from their homeland.</p>\n    <p><span style=\"padding-left: 5em;\"><strong>A dark and unrelenting doom fell. </strong>These people, had come to view this election, not just as the most important in American history, but in the history of the world, this was the decider, the difference between survival and utter oblivion. “There is going to be a war now, it’s what the President wants, this was the chance to stop it, so … there’s really nothing else to say”. I’ve seen tears at elections, I’ve seen faces of horror, but these people are wearing their death masks tonight. Many who have never voted Democratic before, first-time voters or even Trump voters have turned to Tulsi as a legitimate almost savior figure for the country, undeterred by the scandals, apocalyptic rhetoric, and defections from within her own ranks, these were the loyalists, where these people go from here is unknown. “The establishment knifed Tulsi, it goes to show that it’s all a f**king conspiracy, nothing will ever change in this country, they just want to print money until the bombs drop, and believe me it won’t be long now.”</p>\n    <p>The phones had been ringing off the hook. All those backstabbing two-timers, Murdoch, McConnell, McCarthy. They’d written you off, counted you out, and left you for dead. But now they’ve come crawling back. “Congratulations Mr. President” their sheepish, feeble voices emote over the phone. You thank them and make sure that they understand the unparalleled nature of your victory, but you don’t listen to what they have to say, why would you? You don’t need them.

Not putting this on, must be some kind of psychosis, perhaps she is as crazy as you told everyone she really was.</p>\n    <p>“Our country has great challenges ahead and anything I can do to ease that, well I’d be happy to do that”</p>\n    <p>You can’t be fucking serious, she’s asking—begging, for a job now, after you put her out to pasture, a loser like her?</p>\n    <p>“I think it would be great for everyone if in the spirit of unity, we put the campaign behind us and tried something, I think it would be beneficial for the country … and your administration” </p>\n    <p>She falls flat on her face, and now here she is, on her knees, praying not to be thrown out in the cold.

You don't concede when there's theft involved. <br><br>And I was told by the real pollsters — we do have real pollsters — they know that we were going to do well and we were going to win. What I was told, if I went from 63 million, which we had four years ago, to 66 million, there was no chance of losing. Well, we didn't go to 66, we went to 75 million, and they say we lost.

For the last two years, these well-monied men and women had told themselves that change was on the horizon. They had told themselves that the last twelve years of liberal hegemony would finally be at an end. It had to be. How much longer would they have to endure this expansion of the national debt? How much longer would they have to watch as the Democrats surrendered their country’s imperial possessions? How much longer would these liberals force integration down their throats?<br><br>The night had started off with such high hopes, with the party mocking the media for overstating Kennedy’s odds. As the night went on, all but a few true believers had accepted the inevitable. Though there were still votes to count and states to call, Kennedy was on track to victory. They called it for Kennedy at 11:39 PM. Rockefeller came out three minutes later. No music. No warm-up. Just the sound of a thousand jaws tensing at once. He walked like a man who couldn’t believe he was upright. But his eyes were wide open. And absolutely pissed.<br><br>He marched up to the microphone.<br><br>“You blew it.”<br><br>The room froze.<br><br>“You blew it.”<br><br>He scanned the crowd. Not with sadness. With contempt.<br><br>“You told me to wait in 1960. I waited. You told me to step aside in 1964 for a landslide defeat. I stepped aside. You ran a clown in ‘68 and told me I was too much. Now, finally, when it was too damn late to fix the damage, you came crawling back for me to save you.”<br><br>His voice rose.<br><br>“Well, I came. I came. I gave it everything. And you, you, couldn’t even show up with a full deck.”<br><br>He pointed directly at the press row. <br><br>“You handed me a party fractured in three directions. You saddled me with a platform stitched with a fishing line. You thought I could clean it up for you. That’d I’d take the hit and smile for the cameras. That I’d lose politely. Well, to hell with that. Screw all of you.”<br><br>A gasp from somewhere in the hall. <br><br>“I don’t lose politely. I don’t lose for you. You don’t get to use me as a fig leaf for your cowardice. You don’t get to prop me up for a ‘unity’ pledge then undercut me with whispers and whining and leaks and knives in the ribs every goddamn day of this campaign.”<br><br>He grabbed the edge of the podium. White-knuckled.<br><br>“You owe me a victory.”<br><br>“I built this party’s last chance. I handed you a path. You spit on it. Don’t talk to me about loyalty. Don’t talk to me about ‘next time’. You had your shot. And now—”<br>The numbers were bleeding out across the ticker, and it was just after midnight when Spiro Agnew stormed out onto the stage. He shoved past a handler, yanked the curtain across, and pulled the microphone towards him.<br><br>“They stole it.”<br><br>No warning. Just the shot. And now the chaser.<br><br>“You saw it. We all saw it. Dead men voting in Chicago. Boxes dumped in the harbor. Mobs in Philadelphia. A thousand people are dragging this country into the sewer.”<br><br>He wasn’t looking at the crowd. He was looking somewhere else. Somewhere worse.<br><br>“This was a heist. It was a crime scene. Everyone in the media is on it. They helped it happen. They want it this way. They want you ashamed, broke, obedient, and now they want you quiet.”<br><br>He jabbed a finger toward the back of the room. Toward no one.<br><br>“I ran on law and order, they answered with looting and lies. I ran on pride, they smeared it in filth. And now I gotta come out here and concede? Smile for the cameras?”<br><br>He laughed. One hard, empty bark.<br><br>“No. No, I’m not going to tell them that. I’m going to say the truth. They stole it. They’re gonna try and investigate me, for all sorts of things. They had this lined up from the start.”<br><br>“I won all those states. I won America. But you don’t win when the game’s rigged. You don’t win when the ref’s in on it. You don’t win when they’ve got a file with your name on it marke—”<br>There was a sharp tug on his sleeve. Rogers Morton looked down to see one of aides, pimply-faced, wearing a dress shirt too large for him. He stared at the boy. The boy cleared his throat expectantly. Morton, realizing what was happening, gave an apologetic “Oh!” and folded his enormous body to try and reach the aide’s level. Still, the child had to stand on his tip-toes to reach Morton’s ear.<br><br>“Sir, I’m so sorry to bother…”<br><br>Morton waved him off. With the way things were going, he was glad for the distraction.<br><br>“It’s just that, someone’s been calling you all night. I’ve been trying to handle it myself, but the phone’s been ringing off the hook.”<br><br>His feeling of nausea intensified. The damn phone. He could not imagine who was calling him tonight of all nights, but it could not be good.<br><br>“Who is it?”<br><br>The boy shrugged. <br><br>“I couldn’t make it out. Something about the future of the party?”<br><br>Morton let out a petulant groan. With how things were tonight, he could not afford to alienate another person.<br><br>“Alright. Alright. I’ll handle it. Just tell me where the phone is.”<br><br>Together, the pair tried to disentangle themselves from the throngs. They pushed past old women who had long-since stopped waving their miniature American flags. They passed exhausted oil executives and priests. A middle-aged car dealer looked furious, refusing to believe that ${candidatefullname} was on the verge of conceding when there were so many states left to call.<br><br>As they approached the back of the room, the aide pointed to a door. Morton gave a nod of appreciation, opened the door, and hurried inside. <br><br>His first thought upon entering was that the room was too large. Instead of the cramped, wood-paneled and cigarette-smelling room he’d imagined, Morton found himself at the back of what seemed like an enormous auditorium. Rows of seats stretched out before him, each packed with people. Their focus was concentrated on the stage in front of them, at the telephone illuminated by a single spotlight. Rogers stared at it. As it began to ring, he saw himself—or a facsimile of himself—emerge from off-stage and answer it.<br><br>“Sorry,” said the false Morton is a waspish nasal. “This is… You’ve reached the residence of… Oh sorry! Sorry. I’m so sorry!”<br><br>The audience let out a laugh. Morton said nothing. He felt hot and sickly in the darkness. Sweat formed on the back of his neck.<br><br>“Oh, it’s not my fault if people are mad at me! It’s just not a fair world. If it were, I’d be some bit player in Washington and doing something important… like sailing boats on the Chesapeake!”<br><br>More laughter at the impotent tantrum. The other Morton talked and talked. It wasn’t his fault, he pleaded. Other performers appeared on stage and dismissed him as he splayed his enormous body out in supplication. Couldn’t they understand how much he’d sacrificed, he pathetically muttered. He’d given up his dignity, his principles. He’d been willing to destroy his country’s future success. He’d done it all to accommodate them, to get the party over the finish line. Oh why couldn’t anyone—.<br><br>The false Morton tripped over his own telephone wire. Laughter exploded through the room again. Morton felt like he might vomit.<br><br>Was this how people saw him? Was this how they saw Republicans? Had all his humiliations, all his sacrifices been in service of a world that would never like or respect him?<br><br>Yes, thought Morton dismally. It was never about being liked. That had been the trap, the illusion. He’d spent years imagining that dignity and sacrifice might one day be rewarded, but that wasn’t what history remembered. It remembered victory and he had failed to deliver. <br><br>He was a joke without a punchline. He was will without power. This entire period, the last four years of his life, would be swallowed up and remembered only as a vehicle for Kennedy’s story. He was Bobby’s comic relief. If Republicans eventually clawed their way back to relevance, it would have to be under the terms Kennedy and his ilk dictated. <br><br>And he wouldn’t be a part of that.<br><br>As laughter crackled through the theatre, Morton turned toward the door and stepped through the threshold once more. He was once again back in New York. The candidate was finishing his concession speech. The crowd in the hotel was beginning to retreat back to their rooms.<br><br>“Is everything all right, sir?” <br><br>Morton looked down and saw the anxious aide who had first grabbed him. He gave the boy a forced smile.<br><br>“As alright as it will ever be.”</p>",

Still, he tried to maintain his dignity. He had conceded early on Election Night, his surrender graciously accepted by his opponent. He had returned to a White House already beginning to thin as staff looked for other jobs and opportunities. He had pushed forward by doing what he had always done—burying himself in his work. He accepted briefings on the situation in Vietnam, on the struggling economy, on the unrest in cities. <br><br>He gave speeches and issued orders, trying his hardest to ignore the obvious absurdity of it all. Anything he did now would likely be reversed by his successor. He wasn’t president at all. He was a child playing dress up. He wasn’t growing up. He was growing down. As he looked at the newspapers bemoaning every aspect of his Administration, it felt like the entire nation was doing the same.<br><br>Still, he pressed onward. He pressed himself through empty White House hallways, past Secret Service agents who looked at him with a mix of curiosity and sadness. He sealed himself inside his Office, once again ignoring pleas from his wife and his children to enjoy what time he had remaining. He had no intention of doing that. <br><br>There was work to be done. Phone calls to be answered. The answering machine on his desk blinked. Without hesitation, he clicked the button labeled “PLAY”. As the tape whirred, he pretended to organize his paperwork.<br><br>“Bob, it’s Larry O’Brien. I was surprised to receive your call the other day, but I wanted to return it and, uh, wish you a happy birthday.” There was a pause. Something going unsaid. “I’d be happy to help with whatever project you got cooked up after January, but, uh, let’s table that, alright? It’s only been a few weeks.”<br><br>The president scowled. He moved several useless papers from his inbox to his outbox.<br><br>“Bobby, this is Jeff Greenfield. First off, congrats on turning 47. Second, I, uh, got your message about wanting to do a Farewell Address. I’m not sure if you’ve seen the polling numbers recently, but we should maybe discuss options before we go that direction. I’ll send you a memo.”<br><br>Bobby gathered up a collection of documents and slammed them into his garbage bin. He did nothing when the bin tipped sideways.<br><br>“Mr. President, this is Earl Graves. I appreciate you reaching out on your birthday and all, but I don’t think, this close after the election, is the right time to reach out to black—.”<br><br>The president jerked the answering machine toward him and hit the “STOP” button with his thumb. The room lapsed itself into silence. He was alone again. He was alone again in the same room where Jack had spent the last few hours of his life. Unlike Jack, there was no possibility of making his presidency mean anything, of the fight for civil rights or economic justice continue. Instead of being martyred for something greater than himself, his defeat had made his ideas smaller and more marginal. <br><br>Had Jack feared this? As his car glided down those Dallas streets, had he worried that his vitality would be sapped from him? That he might disappoint the country in ‘64 and everything he fought for and believed in would be forgotten?<br><br>He could still remember getting the call from his brother Ted, two days after his birthday. He had been staring at the mass of cheery birthday cards in his garbage bin as his brother wept through the phone, “I’m so sorry. Robert, I’m so sorry. In Dallas. They say in Dallas he was—. Oh Robert. Bobby. Oh, Bobby. I’m sorry he’s—.”<br><br>“Surprise!” <br><br>Lights blared to life overhead. He dropped the papers he’d been holding and only now saw it for what they were—a cheap stage prop. He looked around his office to see it too transformed. He could see through the artifice, through the cheapness of the scenery. A paper American flag. A chipped desk. A plastic red telephone. Jack’s portrait. Less objects than a recreation of them. A memory. A haunting.<br><br>Then, situated across from him, a mass of bodies. Ethel. Moynihan. Unruh. Shriver. Byrd. Connally. Long. McNamara. He stared uncomprehendingly at their smiling faces, at the cake in his wife’s outstretched arms, and then at what lay beyond them, stirring in the darkness beyond him.<br><br>“Oh happy birthday, Bobby!” said the crowd as one. <br><br>Bobby remained frozen beneath the spotlight. His mouth opened and shut as his brain processed what was happening. “N-No… No, this isn’t…”<br><br>“Isn’t what, Bobby-buddy?” said Connally with an exaggerated wink. “Forty-seven is nothing to scoff at. Hell, that’s more birthdays than Jack got.”<br><br>“No. No, I mean, this isn’t what I came here to do. I have work. I have so much work to—.” He was rambling, he knew. His mouth felt dry. <br><br>“Christ, kiddo, leave the work for someone more capable,” said Byrd, detaching himself from the crowd to pick up the papers strewn across the stage. “Haven’t you made enough of a mess already? I mean, God, the stories people will tell about this…”<br><br>“Bobby the fumbler. Bobby the dunce,” said Long, observing Byrd. He frowned. “It doesn’t really have the same ring to it.”<br><br>Shriver cut in, “But I’m sure you’ll be around for a long enough time to make it mean something. You could live another 60, 70 years if you’re lucky. By that time, all these fights about Vietnam, the economy… they’ll seem like nothing.”<br><br>“Will be nothing,” Byrd corrected, now back on his feet.<br><br>“You’ll have your library, your parties to focus on the good stuff like your speeches. All your petty little family dramas. Oh, boy, they’ll get a kick out of the Jack thing. Very cinematic, very <i>theatrical</i>,”  said Connally. “They’ll find meaning in that, long after they’ve forgotten everything you stood for.”<br><br>There was a guffaw of laughter from somewhere out in the darkness. Bobby spun to face it. If he focused hard, he could just make out the masses beyond those stage lights. Countless generations, all watching him. If he could just reach them, hold their hands…<br><br>“No, it was never about any of that,” muttered Kennedy, still staring into the dark. “I never wanted to be just another face on the wall. We were supposed to finish the work. We were supposed to do something, to embody change…”<br><br>“Strange way of embodying it,” said Long. “All those compromises.”<br><br>“All those dead,” said McNamara in a dark and sullen voice.<br><br>There was a long sigh as Moynihan adjusted his spectacles. “Oh, not to worry, Bobby. This country’s yet to find a president it couldn’t add to the pantheon. You’ll maybe not be as bright a star, but you’ll be fine. You lot always are.”<br><br>The president took a step away from the stage’s edge. “This can’t be how it ends. It just can’t,” he muttered. “What about all those possibilities we used to dream of? What about those…”<br><br>“Things that never were?”<br><br>It was his wife’s voice that broke the silence this time. He turned to look at her. She had a strange, sad expression.

            "description": "\t\t\t<h3>The streets are empty.</h3> \n\t\t\t<h3>There are no celebrations, and there are no disappointments.</h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Where we live, we are beyond victors and losers. With this victory, you have achieved the absolute minimum: the default state of political life. It is a testament to nothing except to the fact that the correct buttons were pushed in the correct order. This story is the story of a machine operating correctly.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>The lights dance around your skull. Blue, vermillion, the richness of swollen-red and bloated-purple. They refract from the back of your eyes off the thin layer of gossamer wrapping around this world, piercing every section of your body, every individual red blood cell - and even the white ones, too, dots of alcoholic sunbleached color swirling around your eyes. Everyone's celebrating, every failing organ - they all heard the news before it even reached your brain: somewhere deep, deep inside your body, beneath the calcified layer of ash and tar serving as bedrock in your lungs, there has always been a television tuned to the trashiest, most honest channel. There is a rotten stench exiting your mouth, and you almost don't want to believe that it's the stench of victory.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>They're saying it, of course, in their own language. All around you, in the radio waves zagging around the air. Telecommunicational dialect. They love to talk. Just being able to speak in it is a high, the language of the winners. In a language reinterpreted as a smooth surface - Socialist candidate Milorad Dodik has defeated Opposition candidate Boris Tadić who attempted to mobilize a pan-ideological coalition. Yes. Just like that. Passive voice. It's a collation of facts; you are a natural force; you are a thing that exists, and it isn't worth having opinions about things that exist.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>\"Congratulations, Dodik,\" If Milanovic feels anything, the telephone does not relay it. \"You won the 2012 Yugoslavian Presidential Election.\" And you did! You really did it: Prior to today, there was a sizeable demographic of this country, a certain statistical quantity of people that stretched anywhere from disillusioned ex-Europeanists to Russianist pensioners and rural Kosovars, who believed in their ability to chart a path that hadn’t been dared before, who rebelled against their consciousness, for the first and last time united in the nascent belief that something beautiful could happen. And now, following today, this sizable demographic will no longer exist. As we talk, it is being dissolved. Like a vitamin tablet in a glass of water. You've really taught them a lesson: henceforth, we live in a world without hope.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>His voice flickers through, vowels and nouns in a communicative slurry, amorphous fluid pitch. And then it reconstitutes. Your wife's voice thanks you for being a great husband. Your son, a great father. Your daughter, Vucic, the whole establishment, and the compromised wheezing of the Vodja, too. A procession of warm compassion. It's just like when you were a kid.</p> \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p><glowp>Remember?</glowp> Shake yourself up by your teeth, and remember. Your fourteenth Slava, at your cousin's apartment. The thin white embroideries over the table in the dining room, dimmed lights and orange-amber candles. Light conversation and laughter surrounded you from every corner of the table. You were worried about something you had done. I don’t know what it was, because you won’t tell me. Even now, I can feel the traces of it lingering here. Beside me. The smell of smoke. You might have thought in cynical, damaging ways, but, until that moment, you never felt that you were ethically compromised. You were unable or unwilling to really think about yourself, so you starved yourself for days. Except there, at the Slava.</p> \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p><glowp>Remember?</glowp> The sheer abandonment you were forcing onto your food got to you.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p><glowp>Remember?</glowp> It's like you personified it, and felt bad for it. At that table there existed a subjective reality, at that table, that was altogether kinder than the one you inhabited. No one interacted with you in even a vaguely corresponding capacity, but it's like you had been wandering in a war-torn blast-zone for days.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p><glowp>Remember?</glowp> And this table and these people, these uncles and aunts and removed maternal grandparents, had scooped you up in a truck and were taking you to safety. They were inviting you into a better world. The table was a sieve where the bad things were left behind. That's what it felt like. There was a framed icon of Saint George slaying the dragon on their wall, next to the CRT Television. You remember. Even back then, you were in a state of suspended-animation, an object that existed for a little while and then wouldn't exist anymore. And that would be the end of it. There would be nothing.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Then, on the other end, the fuzz of sounds and familiar voices sharpens. Gradually solidifies. Zooms in on a strain, then consolidates around itself. It's his voice.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>\"Good evening, Dodik.\" It all suddenly descends into terrible focus. You're here. The darkness outside your window pounds against your skull. \"You know why I’m calling.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>“Yeah…” You pause. Chuckling under your breath with the sharp exhales of a snake. “I’m just surprised it took you this long, buddy.”</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>“Get over yourself.” It is a command without feeling and it feels bad and very very good.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>His breath rattles, glass clinking in the background. “Well, you beat me. I guess that’s that.”</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>“Mm...” You stroke your cheek with the back of your hand. Innocuous gestures are transformed into perverse rituals in vicinity to the sheer repugnance of your body. “That’s that. If it’s any consolation? I think… you got closer than most of your braindead allies would have. Like, eh…”</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>“I don’t need you to patronize me.”</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>He can hear your smile in your voice, ichor dripping through teeth. “Then why are you calling me?”</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>What you feel is not exactly anger. It is a dense superiority that spreads in every direction through your veins. Your heart pumps it. “Your whole campaign was a contradiction. What're you, again… some kind of… a social democrat, right? A liberal that prefers illiberals, a civil-rights free-speech crusader that loves Russia and China. Borrowing from the Nordic Model, aligning yourself against the Nordics. Confusing goddamned mess. It was over from the moment it began.”</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>The light in your eyes is like a watchtower searchlight. “And so fucking cocky, too. Like the campaign was just a… some show-trial, prelude to your presidency. I could hear it in your voice, every media appearance, every quip. You weren’t focused on winning. You were focused on proving that you winning would be the natural order of things, that you deserved it. Pathetic…”</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>A glass clinks again, and then in his voice you feel the kind of resignation that sounds tired, fingers rubbing the dust from his eyes. “I think I live in a kind of Hell. I don’t mean a literal one, I mean… this place… has no organized conceptual framework for reality. It’s a chaos of atoms, random sequences of neurotransmitters firing, existence as a bare series of biological events. It’s like it’s impossible not to be neurotic. We love the things we hate, we hate the things we love. We ally ourselves with the people that kill us, prison wardens as saviours… I guess…”</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>His voice melts into the static, losing itself, retreating into a fuzzy amalgam of sounds and shapes. \"Guess what?\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>“I was fine with being a hypocrite if it meant we could escape.”</p>\n",

Couldn’t see it, all the fraud that was in plain sight, all those ballots dumped across the country, the screens and dividers propped up to conceal the truth. But you could see it, the true patriots could see it. And they wouldn’t allow it, couldn’t allow our beautiful country to be destroyed like this. Spineless Republicans just wanted to roll over and watch as the greatest landslide in history was stolen from them. Because they are weak, cowardly traitors. And when the time came, what happened to them? They ran with the rest, retreated into their little hideaways, and blocked the doors. I hear poor little Schiff was crouching in a closet when they got to him.</p>\n    <p>It couldn’t be denied, we had the crowds. The biggest crowds, they’d ever seen. So many, and they came ready to fight, fight for their country, and fight for our great victory. We wanted to do it peacefully, it would have been easy all they had to do was listen, and look at all the corruption across the country, there’s so much evidence, and the courts would have been with us. But they wouldn’t throw out the phony ballots, we had to show them, how mad our people are about this. They don’t want the election stolen, some people get hurt, and some people get shot, but those were Antifa people, not our people. If they all just came out, Nancy and the rest, and admitted to everyone the horrible fraud that happened, it wouldn’t have come to this.</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">TRUMP!<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">TRUMP!<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">TRUMP! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><span style=\"padding-left: 5em;\"><strong>“We can now report that</strong>, Secretary Christopher Miller has urged the National Guard forces not to enter the Capitol grounds, presumably on the orders of the President despite the presence of a riotous mob that has taken over the Capitol building, we have reports that legislators have been taken hostage, video of the mob burning papers and what some are claiming are the electoral ballots, it’s chaos up there and the most shocking moment perhaps when the President of the United States, flew overhead in Marine One, after releasing a statement that can only be described as cheering on this mob, there are smaller incidents in buildings across D.C. including the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee where the President-elect was mere hours ago, it’s pure chaos out here, there has been no report on the whereabouts of either the Vice-President, or Speaker Pelosi, however waves of condemnation of the violence in the city and the lack of police or National Guard response has, at least from the nations Democrats been unanimous … Hold on we have another Tweet from the President I’ll read it verbatim. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What Happened at the Capitol Today Shows What Happens When A Great Victory is STOLEN, Great Patriots Stand Up And FIGHT, THANK YOU ALL, BIG NEWS SOON!!!'</em></strong> … I have no idea what that could mean.”</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">FIGHT! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">FIGHT! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">FIGHT! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Passing through the halls, you can still see them, the handwringers, twitchy wimps scuttering into offices, trying their best to get their testimony straight if things go south. But they won’t, they can’t leave now, we’ve come too far, the orders are out, no surrender, only victory, they won’t steal it from us. A few phone calls reach the right places, the Loyalists, one by one, urging the Vice-President to make the right decision this time all they need is a pep talk from you. “We’re doing so great, you’ve seen the fraud, those people with you can certainly see it, everyone else can, why can’t you?” And soon enough they fall in line, cheered on by the patriot army, confirming your victory. </p>\n    <p>It's a glorious day, the rotten media don’t see it. They were perfectly happy when their side rigs elections, but oh you’ve gone too far, how dare you stand up for yourself, how dare you fight back. Complete enemies of the people, calling it an ‘insurrection’ What does that even mean? This is love, great love for our country, tremendous respect for our country, that’s why we’re doing this. Where’s Nancy? She ran into the tunnels but, no one’s really seen her, I wanted to call her, check if she was OK, perhaps we could work things out after all, we could wrap things up, quite quickly and everyone would go home, that would be the patriotic thing to do, but she didn’t so we had to do it the hard way.</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">NANCY! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">NANCY! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">NANCY! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The White House, this stony temple, an ode to the great Roman Republic.

That’s what we’re doing stopping, the barbarians. The phone calls keep coming, as you sit and watch on the many screens, every network, every channel in the world. Lindsay gets through, a little weak, but you stiffen his spine, tell him we’re fighting, and he slinks onboard, McCarthy’s shaken but won’t cross you, McConnell doesn’t even try to get through, but we can win him back, when we've won.</p>\n    <p>We’re going to make a statement, it’s great. A real humdinger, the speech of the century. Because we’ve got confirmation from the guys in Justice, the Agencies, even the Supreme Court, Clarence and the rest that the fraud was so strong, and the election so-rigged, and now that the Count’s been stopped it goes back to the states, who have been begging to overturn this rigged election.

We had a great call, a great call of tremendous unity, she told me ‘Mr President, you’re doing to right thing, standing up for Taiwan, full support, she said, you have my full support’ She’s gone now, underground apparently, along with the rest, Melania and … because we … we need to be ready, for whatever may come.</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">ONE! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">ONE! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">ONE! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We’re getting tremendous ratings, Pompeo, his briefings it’s thrilling, like a movie, but the pundits the T.V. people, it’s dark stuff, bad for morale and that’s important in wartime, we don’t need this garbage on the screen, talking about blast zones and all these things, it won't come to that, it’s incitement completely provoking these anti-American riots, we’re losing control of our cities, Xi must be laughing looking at us, after we’re taking him to the cleaners in his backyard he should be the one who’s embarrassed, we’ve seen the footage, broke the blockade, if it wasn’t for these people, the war would be over, frankly we’d be celebrating. You tell the Republicans, sitting in their little mountain hideaway you’re not going anywhere, think of the message that would send, the President hiding in some mountain in Alaska, I don’t think so, let the others run, let McConnell crawl into some West Virginia salt pit, You’re not leaving, no-matter what Mark says, staying right here, You’re probably much safer than they are anyway because … it would be unthinkable.</p>\n    <p>The White House, it’s a dark place now, despite the extra security, you sleep in the bunker now, that can’t get out though, only the key staff remain, the food is mostly take-out and fast food, but that doesn’t bother you one bit. Pence is gone too, took him and his family, apparently, they’re in the sky now, flying 24/7. You talked, a good talk, not a last talk, certainly, not a last talk, though you can’t remember what he said, it was some Bible Verse, probably quoting Jesus, but you can’t remember which, it was nice, Karen though she was distraught, tears in her eyes as they huddled onto the chopper, you told her to “Cheer up Karen, we’ve got so many tremendous things to do.”</p>\n    <p><span style=\"padding-left: 5em;\"><strong>And then the call came.</strong></span></p>\n    <p>It takes a while to connect, the whole deep state, is on the calls now, stopping hackers and whatnot.

How’s Jared” <br>\n    <p>“We’re good, Dad, are you coming?

            "description": "<h3>Beneath the Great Seal</h3>\n          <p>George had started the night off in high spirits. His election night party in the Reagan Building in Downtown DC had attracted a large, enthusiastic crowd. Rove had told him that the exit polls in key battleground states seemed to be tilted in their favor. Anderson Cooper, one of his least favorite television personalities, had looked unusually unkempt standing outside a rain-soaked polling station in Michigan. All of these seemed to be good signs.<br><br>He had been in such a good mood from these developments that he had missed the first signs of distress, of the sea liner hitting the iceberg. There was not an immediate call for his victory, as Card had predicted, and every news update seemed to remove victory further from his grasp. Swing states tilted right, then left, then further left still. Votes from cities washed away at their margins elsewhere. He caught Rove nervously cleaning his fingernails with his teeth the one time he emerged from his makeshift green room. He shot the man a thumbs up before grabbing a slice of pizza and scampering back to his makeshift green room to hide. He needed to keep his spirits up. He needed to keep smiling.<br><br>He was still forcing himself to smile by 2:00 AM. While Fox still held out, CNN and MSNBC had called it: George W. Bush had lost the presidency. There were no words coming out of the muted television in his green room, but he could read their lips just fine. “LOSER. LOSER. LOSER.” Even the crowds at his own party seemed to be sarcastic with their chanting, which reverberated through the building. “DON’T BACK DOWN. DON’T BACK DOWN. BACK—.” <br><br>“Sir?”<br><br>George forced himself to turn, to look at the intruder with a warm smile instead of bashing in his face with his fist. He gave a light chuckle, “Oh, Blake, how ya holding up?”<br><br>Blake Gottesman, his bag man, gave a nervous grimace. “Um, fine, sir. I uh…” He shifted from foot to foot like an overlarge child. Behind his grin, George watched the scene. He wondered what he had ever seen in the child. “Your father called. President B—. I mean—. Uh.”<br><br>Blake extended a small, black cellphone from his pocket. George’s smile widened because if he did anything else, he was sure he would scream or break down crying. How had this happened? How had it come to this? In the corner of his eye, he could see the talking heads continue their crusade against him. The whole world was determined to tear him down and now Poppy… <br><br>The thought of his father caused all the anger in him to melt into something far more awful and pathetic.<br><br>“Well, heck, thanks. I suppose I oughta see what’s got his goat.”<br><br>He took the phone from Blake as the boy retreated to the hall. He stared for a moment at the black device and then, before he could think twice, took it off hold.<br><br>“Looks like your luck finally ran out, Junior,” came the crackle of a voice through the receiver.<br><br>George’s voice was not his campaign-trained, cowboy twang but something childish. Cloying. “It wasn’t luck, Poppy. I worked hard.”<br><br>“Mhm. Sure.”<br><br>“And we don’t know it’s over yet. There’s still votes to be counted in—.”<br><br>“No, George, there’s not. Jeb can’t bail you out of this one,” There was a long pause. George thought he could hear the clinking of a glass being set on a table followed by a sigh. “What a goddamn mess. What a waste.”<br><br>George said nothing. <br><br>“A generation of political capital squandered on idiot ambitions. If you had listened to me at any point in the last four years, we wouldn’t be here now. I should have known after Cheney weaseled his way onto the ticket, after the shitshow you pulled with North Korea…”<br><br>George stared intensely at his feet. He could actually feel himself sinking, could see the fragments of his presidency floating on the waves and turning into junk.<br><br>“Your brother never would have gotten himself here.”<br><br>“Poppy, I—.” There was so much he wanted to say, but instead he heard himself mutter, “I know.”<br><br>“Well, at least you’re finally being honest with yourself. Christ.” Another pause. Another clink of the glass. “I guess we have work to do. I’m sure Rove’s people will have you doing all kinds of tricks tonight to keep the people at your election party from rioting, but Jeb and I will call tomorrow to figure out next steps. Just don’t screw up anything else before we can talk again, okay?”<br><br>Bush nodded and then, aware that it wouldn’t carry, spoke into the phone. “Okay, Poppy. I should probably go now.” He rubbed his face. “I love you. Make sure to tell mother I said the same to her.”<br><br>Through the static, there was a grunt. “Okay, George. Night.”<br><br>The line went dead. George stood in silence in his room for several minutes, wallowing in his desolation. Then, slowly, he reassembled his mask of confidence. He forced himself to stroll out his door, past Blake and Rove and throngs of pitying aides. He spoke briefly with his handlers about what to say to the crowd and allowed a woman to fix his smeared make-up. When all was done, he found Laura, looped his arm into her’s, and pecked her on the cheek—a gesture he had once seen his father do. Then, without any further hesitation, George stepped out onto the stage before the disappointed crowd. Blinded by the stage lights, George tried not to imagine what the future would hold.<p>",

            "description": "<h3>It isn't a city anymore.</h3> \n\t\t\t<h3>What it is is a plane for the convergence of human bodies.</h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>They slip down the streets like a liquid, swooshing against the buildings and alleyways - when viewed from the top-down, like water overflowing the tunneling of an ant colony. They wave their banners, gold-blue and white-yellow. Battle flags in a complex operation against your existence. From the left flank, piercing into the centre. The most humiliating part: by the time the first banners were raised, they had already won the battle. Long, long ago. At night, in the horizon beyond the fields and hills, the blinking red-white-yellow city lights look like a watchtower - constant, instant, wrapping around your eyelids in full rotation.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>But you're not in the city anymore. Sweaty and shambling, miles away from the highway where your abandoned car blinkers into the night. The moonlight rubs itself into your retinas, illuminating strips slipping themselves around your gloves, your shoes, shiny leather new and beautiful, tamping down on the soft gravel that feels like it's going to give way below you and send you falling straight into the centre of the earth's crust.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>All of it will.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>The grass will split open and the sky will close down against your forehead, pounding your skull into your spinal cord like hammering a nail into drywall. How the fuck did you manage to lose? You had everything you could have ever wanted. A perfected post-apocalypse that only had to be gently renewed - you had the momentum of the planet’s orbit behind your back. You had everything that I never had. And you still let all of them down. Beaten to death by a group of cognitively dissonant ideological amalgams, utterly obliterated by a broad circus of self-hating progressives taking up arms with their racist grandparents and nationalist neighbors in slavish dedication to an ideology that only functions to the same extent that it works against itself: liberal populism.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>You're looking for something, and it's looking for you. I won't tell you where it is, no matter how much you ask me. You can only find it through the shrubbage and the feeling of the shapes of the sticks under your feet. Further into the darkness. When you walk in darkness too long, your eyes adjust to it, and turn themselves inwards to the back of your skull - and from the darkness, things begin emerging. The things you love and the things you hate, the purple-green outline of reality, an entire world as dim and varicolored as closing your eyes in the shower as a child. The air compresses into itself like pressurized static, pulsating in your nostrils. The sirens and searchlights in the distance swirl into a block of light and sound that overtakes you.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>You're tumbling down. Down. Down. Infinitely fast; there is no limit to the speed with which the human mind can descend into misery.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>And when the light drains from your eyes - it's the largest thing you've ever seen. White marble, golden embossed font. A Monolith. So much larger than your reality, and so much smaller than you. A nameless funeral, a block integrated into this earth. From it, you hear the voices. From the city, all around. They emerge, ambushing you from the treeline, from the steep downhill you fell down and your attempts to retreat into it, legs buckling and falling down, from the synapses inside your fucking head.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>\"I did everything that I could for you,\" Milanovic, murderous. \"And you repay me by ruining my fucking career.\" And then it's your wife, as soft and gentle and absent as your mother and it's not fair that this is happening while you're sober, your son and your daughter, the Vodja - who in his sheer hatred for you miraculously achieves a kind of terminal lucidity, a procession of contempt reserved entirely for you. Even when you were a kid, the contempt was branded into your fucking skull. Like a scalding iron. Thrown into pits and ridiculed, wheezed and coughed from all the cigarettes and aftersmoke your parents were forcing you to inhale. You were so fucking fat, slower, perpetually behind the other kids in ways you could feel but never explain. Every morning you involuntarily have the thought that you wish you could go back in time and kill yourself. You and your body have something fundamental in common: from the very beginning, all they've known is betraying the people they belong to. You inherited your father's miserable sobbing.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>And then the procession slows down. Overflows, scrambles out of order, scrambling against the air before reconstituting into a singular shape. It's him. His pipe dangles from his mouth and his coat droops down to the ground, peaked cap held against his chest.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p><glowp>\"Milorad,\"</glowp> he begins. It's not something you hear. It's a beating inside your heart, eternal. <glowp>\"You failed me.\"</glowp></p> \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>You walk across the ground on fours towards it, fingernails bleeding, scratching against the dirt. \"I didn't mean it... I didn't mean to...\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>It hurts too much. <glowp>\"You sold yourself to the highest bidder to fund your centralist fantasies of domination, a smokescreen behind which lies a sheer emptiness that would make even the most ideologically destitute among you blush. Money as power, power for the sake of power. This, you disguised so poorly, it drove all into the hands of a bourgeoisie opportunist, a mountebank that believes in nothing so that he can believe in everything.\"</glowp></p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Your voice is giving out. \"But... but...\"</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p><glowp>\"Do you know the worst part, Milorad?\"</glowp></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>How are you not tired of being yourself?</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><glowp>\"You and him are more alike than not.\"</glowp></p>\n\n\t\t\t`<p><img src=\"https://file.garden/YfskK7H8Sw3Gtah5/tadicpartial.png\" width=\"967\" height=\"900\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: -8.5em; margin-right: auto;\"></p>\n",

            "description": "<h3>Change Comes to Washington</h3>\n          <p>Revolutionary.</p><p>It was revolutionary in Chicago.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden still held some delusion he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He was too old, too backwards in his thinking. A fine enough substitute to win over those initially cautious of a Black man with a funny name with the comforting reassurance of his old, white presence, but the time for that had passed. His assistance was no longer required. Obama had broke through the barriers placed ahead of him and no longer required handicaps in the metaphorical and literal sense.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden sat there, just festering in contempt for having been booted off the ticket in unceremonial fashion. He had as much relevance to the final years of his boss's first term as Sunny and Bo. Actually, he probably had even less than that. “Oh, yeah. Sure was.” Biden rolled his eyes, wondering why he was even invited to this meeting, Clinton's coronation was undoubtedly assured, he thought erroneously. Little did either of them know...</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go, being she'd be the vice president. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. Sure. The last four years were, quite frankly, a shitshow. Obama evidently held true to those aspirations of change she would see and break out of every staffer that entered her office throughout her Senate tenure, but with her selection, she held a sense that he was coming around. He was finally coming to grips with the reality of the situation. The need to compromise, to get tough, to start thinking beyond himself and his selfish desires and for the good of the country. The world. She was in for a surprise.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she thought knew what to expect, Biden too. The dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running early in Obama's term, now reality had him buried under six feet of bricks and broken dreams. He slightly mumbled and squeaked his rubber shoes on the Oval Office carpet.</p><p>“Neither of you.”</p><p>There was a silence. Clinton and Biden merely stared, dead-eyed at Obama as he uttered those three solitary words. After some slight twitching, Clinton came to and further inquired.</p><p>“What.”</p><p>Obama inched forward and leaned on his desk, head slightly turned downward with only his eyes peering directly at Clinton's direction. “I've decided neither of you are what I, uh, intend for the next administration to look like. I'd think it best we went in a different direction.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes, then back at Clinton. Biden was so out of it already this was all failing to faze him, he just kept staring blankly, meanwhile Clinton's expression was one of shock and terror. She needed to say something soon lest she develop cotton mouth. But nothing was coming out. She just kept staring at Obama, in a way that perturbed the president to a great degree. He placed his hand closer to the desk's emergency button in case security needed to be alarmed.</p><p>“I hope no ill intent is being, um, you know, communicated by this. I respect you two enough to give you this information early, so you may make your plans with this in mind. I'm hoping y-you both, uh, are taking this well.”</p><p>Biden looked slightly less animated than one of those animatronics out of Disney's Hall of Presidents, Clinton continued to stare at Obama, a glint in her eye being the only communication that was being dispatched to the president. Her boss, for the next four years. Her boss who just told her, to her face, that her clear ambitions were going to be directly challenged and her influence was, clearly, going to be trifled and belittled. The post of vice president was not a ladder, it was a prison. One Obama intended to keep her in until he could get what he really wanted come 2016. Her new job was a prison sentence, one she couldn't escape, at least not for a little while longer, in the precious time that'd she'd otherwise need to craft her bid.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Obama stood up, not eagerly anticipating whatever threat Clinton was going to muster after her brain had finished flipping through all the ways she could have him killed in the meantime. He gestured over to Biden.</p><p>“Why don't I buy you a drink, or uh, in your case, a soda or something, Joe?” Obama patted Biden on the shoulder, who, in a way similar to elderly grandparents just barely comprehending what had been said to them in a hushed tone by a relative, turned over in a brief silence. After a quarter of a minute, he nodded. “Alright, Jack. You're paying.” He got up and the two made their way out of the room.</p><p>Clinton continued to stare at the chair as if Obama was still sitting in it, as he flicked the lightswitch off, leaving her in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Clinton didn't budge, she was already familiar with it.</p>",

            "description": "<h3>A Full Measure of Happiness</h3>\n          <p>Adequate.</p><p>It was adequate in Chicago.</p><p>Obama had just gotten off the stage, speaking to hundreds of thousands here, across the nation, and around the globe; he delivered his speech with all the usual pomp and circumstance that came with winning a battle. He didn't fail to address the battles still to be won, of course, that being electoral ones, not anything to do with policy or keeping a consistent belief system. It's a win as hollow as the one before it, and it'll be viewed as such in the years to come. A faint illusion, not for those below yet all too real for the ones above. Their lives have been changed forever, and their lives are the only ones that matter.</p><p>Boarding Air Force One back to Washington, the night was a splendid affair midway as everyone in the administration and those deemed of real importance to the campaign got caught up in the celebratory fever. Cocktails and champagne ready in supply, there were lobster tails cooked to a perfect degree with hot butter lathered on top. How far we've come. Axelrod reminisced with Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, who hopped along to enjoy some of the festivities before he'd catch a plane in the morning back to the Windy City. Obama avoided the commotion and stared longingly out the window into the pitch black darkness of the night sky. The noise of laughter and singing couldn't detract from the penetrating silence that was occupying his inner monologue.</p><p>It was a few hours later, back in the Oval Office, Obama was overlooking the Resolute Desk where he'd remain for another four more years. Vice President Biden was seated ahead with Secretary Clinton alongside. Biden was pleased with the proceedings, under the delusion his maintaining of the post of the vice presidency meant he had a shot at possibly winning the Democratic nomination come 2016. Obama knew he couldn't allow that. He never trusted Biden and that remained the case, whether he stayed along for the ride or not. It was Hillary's time, any suggestion otherwise was to be perceived as an insult. After all, he and Hillary had developed a bond not anticipated by the time this all first began. They were enemies once, Hillary was the villain and him the hero. He was the voice of the people, the radicals, or so it may have seemed.</p><p>“It was a, uh, great win we've earned for ourselves, was it not?” Obama felt it right to commence small talk proceedings, before he'd launch into the purpose behind his assembly of the two in the early hours that followed election night.</p><p>Biden nodded along, as intrepidly mindless as ever. “Sure was, Jack. I know Hillary over here was worried, but, I thought it a bunch of malarky. I never doubted you for a second.” He lightly hit his fist on Obama's desk in a playful manner. What an absolute waste of flesh and bones this sack of shit was, Obama thought.</p><p>“Oh, that right,” Obama played along and forced out a pity chuckle, “uh, that true then, Hillary?”</p><p>Clinton was calm, measured. She was already deliberating the next four years and how'd they go. The actions the administration will take, as she had helped craft the direction. It all went as perfectly planned as she could have ever hoped. It was funny, she looked back, how worried she was of Obama. She really thought he'd ruin everything and, this is too amusing now, burn it all down and rebuild. Like he'd take the situation and, this is bordering on ridiculous now, but break the banks or reshape the Court to abide by his leftist whims. She misread him badly, that was the one mistake she was okay in owning up to. No, Obama was one of the good ones. He was a reasonable man, and a good governing partner.</p><p>“Barack, I never doubted you for a second. Don't listen to Joe here, he was the one getting nervous.” She let out a cackle that unnervingly echoed the room.</p><p>Obama hunched over, ready to get to business and not waste anymore precious time. “With the, um, uh, circumstances, how these presidencies go, of course eight years is all we've been allowed to exercise. Unfortunately. So, uh, I don't think it has escaped either you two that, among many candidates on offer, I value both of your talents. I greatly appreciate the help and work you both put into making this administration the success it was, and will be seen as being for the rest of, uh, time.” He leaned back slightly and tapped the desk softly with his knuckles. “I want to address which of you two I will be supporting in 2016.”</p><p>Clinton was unmoved, she knew what to expect. Biden got slightly giddy, the dumb son of a bitch actually thought he might be in the running and had a bounce to him following Obama's statement. His right leg reflexively jumped up-and-down in anticipation.</p><p>“Hillary, I have my full faith that you'll, uh, steer the ship back to where we need it, and after you're done we'll be one step closer to progress. I want you to know you have my full and complete endorseme-”</p><p>“Hold on a second. You invited me to hear this? What the hell is this about, Barry?” Biden was legitimately shaken. He wasn't a naive fool, though his senses were being depleted by the cruel hand of time everyday, he'd been in this business for the majority of his life, so he knew backroom deals were how it worked, but to be treated like this was something truly disrespectful. “You brought me here to hear this? You know I...I don't mean any offense Hillary, but...I don't know why you even brought me here just to humiliate me like this.”</p><p>Obama calmly looked Biden in the eyes. Clinton just averted her gaze, not entirely concerned with Biden's sore feelings, she was interested in moving on from the topic to greater things, like Obama's plans on how his second term will deal with Syria or Iran.</p><p>“There's no harm intended, Joe. I'm, uh, granting you the respect you deserve to know my decision early so you don't decide to make any brash or foolish moves in the future, to attempt to, uh, subvert or betray my trust. I am, um, attempting to illustrate to you, if you are so stupid as to pull a dumb move to sabotage Hillary, we will destroy you. Quickly. Me, Hillary, Pelosi if needed, we never, ever wish to do something of such ill-intent like that, but Joe, we will. We can break you and shatter you like dust. I'm saying this as a, uh, friend, Joe.”</p><p>Again, Biden knew all of that already. He just never thought he'd be in the position to be on the receiving end of it all. He had dedicated his lifetime to the party, poured his blood, sweat, and tears into it. But now it had finally come to chew and spit him out. His time had passed.</p><p>“I understand, Mr. President.” Biden tried to mask his disappointment to no avail. Not that anyone cared to notice.</p><p>Maybe he'd gather the courage to stand on his own two feet in opposition to it all. Unlikely. Maybe, perhaps, some crazy thought, Hillary could even lose in 2016 and he could...no...that's ridiculous...his brain is already fading. Who'd want him in 2020? 2024? Biden just sat looking at his feet while Obama and Clinton carried on.</p><p>“Hillary, I, uh, wish to speak to you alone, now. Meet me in the hallway.” Obama patted the desk and left. Clinton got up shortly after, but not before briefly whispering in Biden's ear. “All power is fleeting, Joe.” She rubbed his shoulder and departed.</p><p>Biden sat there as Clinton flicked the lightswitch off, leaving him in pitch darkness. Behind the Resolute Desk were the open windows to the Washington sky, as black as the night Obama had flew in from. Biden slowly looked up into it, and was finally enveloped whole.</p>",

He felt that this stupid fucking whore had taken enough of her time in the spotlight. He couldn't accept it anymore. He allowed hatred to fester inside of him as it rot his heart, fresh from a fucking corpse's donation. He refused to accept that she was even running in the first place.<br><br>Then came forth the results of this carnival: The 270 was reached by this hillbilly high-priced prostitute and his hate-spew could finally be justified. He let out a tirade of anger, a tirade of pus pulled out of the boils in his head. He had enough of seeing this bullshit. He had walked out a long time ago, refusing to allow her the graciousness of constitutional politeness.<br><br>The election map was almost a joke derived from the mad ravings of a 1968 nostalgia trip: Alabama had gone blue, Louisiana had gone blue and so forth.

In a nearly perfectly split second convention, back-up Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell won the nomination. The progressive branch of the party, headed by John McCain and Mitt Romney, had their delegates walk out of the convention to reform Teddy Roosevelt's Progressive Conservative party. \n\nOn the left, the quite unpopular with progressives Hilary Clinton had a similar situation over a split regarding corporate welfare, the more left wing Bernie Sanders has nearly split the party in half, getting behind the Green Party for the upcoming Senate race and easily winning their nomination.",
